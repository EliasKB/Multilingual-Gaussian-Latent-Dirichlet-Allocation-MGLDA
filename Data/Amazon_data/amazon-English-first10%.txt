music neg 241.txt i bought this album because i loved the title song . it 's such a great song , how bad can the rest of the album be , right ? well , the rest of the songs are just filler and are n't worth the money i paid for this . it 's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe . kenny chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the nashville music scene . he 's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town . i 'll get down off my soapbox now . but country music really needs to get back to it 's roots and stop this pop nonsense . what country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things .

camera neg 715.txt in my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily . it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise . this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable . my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended . i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate 
books neg 120.txt first off i 'd like to tell you that this is only the second star wars book i 've ever read , ' jedi search ' being the first . i actually liked the first book , it drew upon the star wars lore well and was a decent read . however , this book made me groan in so many places that i felt almost compelled to create an account here to have a little rant about it ( be warned , this may contain a few spoilers ) . thusly : how much of the book was wasted with overly long descriptions ? it reminds me of a ' little britain ' sketch where a woman author is dictating her new book and starts reading the bible out to make up the space ! i do n't mind the story being 20-odd pages shorter if it comes to the point ! for some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken every opportunity to ' ground ' the story by constantly relating to the star wars films . for example , when wedge and the scientist go to that forest-resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there , he says something along the lines of : i was actually in the cantina in mos eisley when luke met han and chewbacca , little did i know the brush i had with history there... . gahhhhhhh ! ! ! why ! ? how did he know ! ? it did n't need it ! ! *bangs head on desk* he does this throughout the two books i 've read so far ! ! how about the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something new without ' proving ' that it 's true by telling the readers that it was from a certain scene in one of the films ? then there 's admiral daala . made an admiral because of her brilliant military skills and quick thinking... . so what is she doing in this ? she 's reviewing recordings of speeches given by tarkin over military tactics and following them to the letter and losing ! it 's only the end of the second book and she 's down to 1 star destroyer ! she should live up to her reputation and at least have a few successful campaigns before the inevitable happens . ( i.e. the rebellion win ) he then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant idea , that of having a jedi academy ( the point of the trilogy ! ) . there 's so much that could have been done here - new and original training for the jedi , but no - he has the jedi go two-by-two into the forest ( holding hands ? ) to *sense* things.. . it 's meant to be a sci-fi series ! something could have been done to make this so much better ! i was incensed to find that luke was actually made ' boring ' in this book . part of my motivation for starting to read the series in the first place was to see how luke had grown . it all started very promisingly in the first book , having learnt that luke had turned to the dark side and come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more powerful than ever ! ( cool ! i thought ) . it got to the stage where i 'd dread coming back to the jedi parts of the story because he was so dull . the other trainee jedi needed serious character development ( they were 1 dimensional ! ) - entering every scene with luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing just was n't good enough . as other reviewers have said - one of his students goes rogue , somehow gains the knowledge of building a super-lightsabre ( great idea btw ! ! we need more of that ! ) then is discovered burnt to death in his quarters.. . and luke just meditates about it ! ? *grr* okay all that being said it was ' okay ' and on the strength of the first book i will be reading the next book ( it 's like a car accident - you 've just got to look ! ) . 
health pos 80.txt this is a very good shaver for the private area . however , the key to getting the best results is to trim the longer hairs with scissors or the largest guard first . this will keep the shaver from pulling on the longer hairs and will enable the foil part of the shaver to work . the foil will not be able to do its job if the hairs are too long . the only problem i had with the shaver was that it did not enable me to shave my back like it claimed . however , i use the ' mangroomer ' back shaver for this and it is perfect for you to shave off all your back hair easily with its elongated handle . it is a great product as well . therefore , i would have to say these two products coupled together seem to cover all the bases for men 's grooming on the body . i would highly recommend both of them for perfect manscaping results

camera pos 6.txt i believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. forget about zoom lenses even if they are l . this lens is far better than 70-200l in my opinion . it is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. with zoom lenses you have to set to f / 5.6 for better result and f / 8 to match this lens . it is very well built but not excessive heavy , come with hood and bag , but unfortunately , canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the l lenses . combined with a tamron 1.4x teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom l lenses at 189mm focal length . yes i know i lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens . but i am really happy that i decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200is to 135 / 2l+1.4x . this not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures , especially at wide open . better portrait lenses , like 200 / 1.8 and 300 / 2.8 , would cost several thousands of dollars . trust me , once you play with primes , you will not like zoom anymore . i am also using a 24-70l to shoot my small kid . after using this lens , i do n't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday , the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6x crop factor of digital camera . a 35mm / 1.4l will become 56mm which is really not good . order from amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock . they shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated " in stock soon " . pros : very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5. very fast lens with f / 2 very good bokeh ( background blurring ) . overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast / color . smaller size , less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s . it is a l lens : best build quality , fast / quiet ring usm af with ftm . cons : no hard case . no inexpensive . effective focal length is 216mm on 10d / 20d / rebel / 300d which is a little difficult to use for portrait

software pos 439.txt our photo and video editing softwares were both very basic and " old " , so we decided to upgrade a couple of months ago . after reading many reviews on different bundles , we decided to get the adobe photoshop elements 5.0 premiere elements 3.0 bundle . we 've played around with the premiere elements a bit , and it 's really awesome . much better than the pinnacle studio 8 we had before . all the basic functions are easy to use and very intuitive , though we have n't gone and figured out the more advanced features yet . the photoshop elements is a wonderful tool , as well . we recently had to scan in a lot of old pictures ( as in 20+ year old b / w photographs ) . they needed a lot of touching up , and elements 5.0 worked wonderfully for that . i could adjust the lighting and sharpening , fix the colors and scratches , and the pictures turned out amazing . you 'd never be able to tell they were scanned images from such old photographs . the program is also very intuitive . i could do all the things i wanted to do without having to read the manual . of course , i 'm still just touching on the surface of what all is possible , and i plan on reading the manual and studying the program in more detail once i have the time to do so , but for what i need right now , it 's easy to use and does a good job . there are only two things i have to comment on that i do n't like about the adobe bundle , and they are the reason why i 'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. 1. the stated minimum requirements for this bundle are 512mb ram . that 's what we had on our computer , and while the program worked , it was so painfully slow that it was n't feasible to really use it . we ended up upgrading to 1gb , and it 's been working great since . so if you have less than 1gb ram , make sure you upgrade before getting this software ! 2. the red-eye fix in photoshop elements , or lack thereof . there is an auto red-eye fix , but it does n't work very well . it finds red eyes in all kinds of places , just not where they actually are . sometimes it covers half the face , sometimes only half of the eye , etc. etc. etc. there is an option to manually show the program where the red eye is , but it still does n't work right . maybe there 's another trick i have n't found out about yet , but as of right now , i usually give the fix tool a shot , and if it does n't work i take the picture back into my old editing software and fix the red eye there . i 'm really very disappointed with this , as fixing red eyes is something you have to do quite frequently when editing pictures . overall , the software has been very easy and fun to work with , even for an amateur like me . :o ) if adobe can adjust the minimum requirements recommendation and fix the red-eye fix tool , it 's going to definitely deserve 5 points

camera pos 30.txt i shoot with a canon 20d and have used the canon ef 75-300mm f / 4.5-5.6 iii usm lens . i 've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed the lens lineup at the canon website and decided on the canon ef 100-400mm f / 4.5-5.6l usm lens . the 100-400mm is a great lens , but it can be a bit soft . for that reason i decided to add the canon ef 70-200mm 2.8 / f is usm telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection . this is a serious lens meant for serious photographers . being an l lens , there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance . the construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups . the four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration . an improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image . the canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs / 1 , 470 g , and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft / 1.3 m. this lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x ii and 2x ii . be sure to get a good quality uv haze filter to protect the front lens element . being white , this lens looks a bit strange , but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun . some people are concerned that being white , it attracts attention to criminals . from my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless of what lens i put on it . in addition , i most likely have a camera bag and tripod / monopod with me to further attract attention . i personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload . i try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up . the dual is system has two modes . mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects . it is recommended that the is function is not used on a tripod ; however i have used it on my monopod with success . the is helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle . while there are limitations to what the is can do , it can give you a few extra stops . just keep in mind , the is attempts to eliminate camera movement , not the movement of the subject being photographed . this lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set . there is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m / 4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m / 8.2ft to infinity . included with this lens are the tripod mount , lens hood , and storage case . the tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod . this helps to balance the load . mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over . the case is a zippered soft case ( lz1324 ) that can also be purchased separately . the lens hood ( et-86 ) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations . often times , amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood , however they are normally included with the lens . the canon ef 70-200mm is such an awesome lens , it almost fails to compare to the canon ef 75-300mm . the canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me , but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm is lens is more refined . the auto-focus is quiet and quick . this lens can be used for portraits , landscape , sports or as a general walk about lens . the f / 2.8l combined with the is makes this a good option for certain low light situations . the features add creative versatility . the canon ef 70-200mm is lens comes at a price , but it is worth every bit of it . pros : incredible clarity and sharpness quiet and quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual is system cons : heavy and bulky ( this should be expected with these types of lenses

books neg 52.txt this book was on a very interseting topic . the author took time in studying this topic . it was about the impending world oil shortage . that is the time when we , the world , will run out of oil . it tells you about hubbert 's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil . they then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from . then they talk about where oil is . they also talk about drilling for oil . they say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil . sometimes it will take even more time then that . then they talk about the size of oil fields . they also reexamine hubbert 's analysis later on in the book . rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future . they talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases . they also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have . hubbert was a brilliant man . some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he did n't want to he told everybody . the author was ver knowledgable and i could tell he knew what he was talking about . i would n't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage . i say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring . when you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring . i gave it a low rating because i have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book

dvd pos 168.txt i 'm told by fellow film enthusiasts that buuel 's later films do not show this spanish master at his best , that his earliest films- --his famous collaborations with salvador dal , for instance- --show an edgier , more fascinating buuel . whatever . i saw his 1974 film the phantom of liberty for the first time recently , and i immediately fell in love with it . there are those who swear by his more popular 1972 oscar-winner the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie , but somehow i think the phantom of liberty is even more entertaining than discreet charm . there is no plot to speak of in phantom : this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds buuel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images . monks pray for a woman 's sick father , and then play poker with the woman and smoke . a group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets , and go to the bathroom to eat in private . two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter- --even though she 's right there in class when they call her name . in the universe buuel concocts in the phantom of liberty , anything goes . the amazing thing about this movie is that , instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches , the phantom of liberty has a broad theme to support its free-form structure : it 's buuel 's comic vision of freedom run amuck . sure , the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone...but , as buuel seems to be suggesting , even freedom has its limits . the opening scene of the movie is set in toledo , spain in 1808 , as napoleon 's troops attempt to liberate the spanish and are greeted with cries of " down with liberty ! " there can be times when we want the assurance of authority , rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please . buuel does n't take a stand one way or the other , really ; he 's just an artist who is intrigued by the idea , and his interest fuels the free-form structure of the film , and its content . almost anything and everything he can think of- --within the bounds , i suppose , of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career- --is thrown into this movie , and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure , i found its elegant chaos exhilarating . only a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this . i think buuel pulls it off triumphantly here ; somehow , he makes the movie seem almost logical , the way it progresses . the phantom of liberty is a sheer delight . highly recommended

dvd pos 215.txt having visited st. petersburg , russia a year ago , i could not pass up the chance to watch this movie . i must say , it was nicely done . i can relate to the obnoxious , business like brother...who happily did not go with me on my trip . i was more like the care-free younger brother , but not quite so care-free as the character protrayed . the scenery was awesome...all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie...although i wish there were more because the city is full of beauty . and this goes for the women as well ! ! i mainly went to see the city...but i also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that i planned would be my travel companion . what i did n't expect was to really fall in love : - ) . the big reason why i confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to american women...as if explained in the additional extras on the dvd...but the russian lady that i met there and the culture of her up-bringing quickly changed my way of thinking ! ! one thing i should add though . the movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself . such is not the case . it takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here...expect at least 8 months , but it is more like a year . it is time consuming to get her a us visa . but she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover , the wait is worthwhile . another word of caution : prepare yourself to fall in love with russia...the people are very nice and i know of a lot of americans who go there quite often to visit and re-visit...some even live there now 
music neg 407.txt just like in my other review i ca n't figure out the madness over these guys . i will ask in this post as well for somebody to actually explain to me why they should be heard and are relevant in a creative way . honestly people you ca n't call these guys artists . an artist creates something from a idea or two these guys take those ideas and just lump them together . it 's as simple as that . and to top it of they do n't have the chops as musicians to be relevant in that form either . a comment like " they rock " or " the lead singer is soooo hot " are n't examples of a great artist or band . from the dates of the last post my words might be in vain , kind of like the validity of this record . because there has n't been a post on here for two years . if a fan of banking benjamins does stumble upon this post i invite you to check out my other reviews , and checkout some relevant and great music 
books pos 46.txt this book , styron 's finest , is about redemption . heralded by the epigraph from john donne , the intricately structured tale with its marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that it 's impossible to put down . but it 's also to styron 's great credit that the novel 's theme , redemption through confrontation with death and violence , is reflected through its feverish style . there are not many books in the postwar era , and none in the united states , that have such a non-moralistic but intensely moral character and impact . echoes of the greek tragedians ( several times evoked in the text ) and of dostoyevski abound . finally , the crucial role by the most-fleshed out non-expatriate character , a philosophical italian small-town cop named luigi , elevates the moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers do n't even seem to understand , let alone approach . it 's a shame that styron has not received the nobel prize yet

dvd neg 59.txt the casting for this production could scarcely be better ( of particular note is the harrowing performance of judi dench ) and it 's one of shakespeare 's best plays . that said , this film of a production on stage does n't quite carry the viewer 's interest for the entire play . there are times when the actors seem downright pretentious ; you feel as if they 're tellings us , " we know how deep this is so appreciate it , please . " that 's too bad since " macbeth " is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film . sadly , this relatively slow-moving production is n't it . there are , of course , wonderful moments with mackellan and particularly dench ( no one plays the scene where lady macbeth goes crazy better than dame judi ) . i just do n't know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase . for my money , kurosawa 's " throne of blood " is a far better choice .

books pos 852.txt i was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality . blamires had c.s. lewis as a tutor , and i 've read some of lewis 's writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special ( many people do find his works special of course ) . blamires , on the other hand , i find to be very unique - his book is top quality and very helpful . i 'm surprised this is n't a very popular book , as it ought to be . i have only two complaints , both of which are purely stylistic . first , the edition i have looks like it 's a copy of an earlier edition , which makes the text hard to read ( i got used to it after a while though ) . some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it . my second criticism is something that ca n't be avoided - the book was originally written in the early sixties , so a lot of the examples are dated ( i.e. references to wwii , which was still in memory , also out-of-date terms like " jive " , etc. ) . however , just a few of the examples are affected by this . the book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work , since so much blamires 's criticism of the christian mind ( or lack thereof ) still ( sadly ) applies . however , the christian mind today is being rediscovered , and the march of atheism is on the decline , with the march of religion in general on the rise . even though things are looking up , christians should keep blamires 's book in mind - not to get too comfortable with this ( secular ) world , for our real home is beyond bodily death . that we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book . superb book , and i really recommend this to anyone . this is definitely recommended for christians , and also for any non-christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems christians have today

dvd pos 695.txt i have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto dvd- -it is here ! a very good movie . i have to say the inspector carson ( belonging to an unknown federal agency ) , character played by kurtwood smith is good if not great acting . he epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate . his lines in the movie ( particularly when he and border patrol agent bobby logan , kris kristofferson ) discuss ' politics ' during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best . the conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra... . great bit part acting by rip torn , roberts blossom ( as the desert rat ) , tess harper and the young and sultry jean smart . kris kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and treat williams does ok as well . anyone who has been in law enforcement- -or any other supervisory capacity for that matter- -has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the border patrol : totally inept . the soundtrack by tangerine dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes . a must see movie .

dvd pos 753.txt i feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated . there were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted , but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly ( ex. one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static ) . the costumes were well selected , but i felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard ( you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face ) . this version follows the book well , though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the " drink me " bottle . i also felt that the british accents in the movie enhanced the film . i recomend this to fans and people who are n't overly critical of films

software pos 682.txt i chose office ultimate 2007 as it seemed to not only have everything i could possibly need to run a business , but also easy functionality that would keep me from pulling my hair out because of software or design issues . ultimate 2007 certainly does n't disappoint ! - set up was fairly easy : two disks came with the package . disk one contains most of the software and disk two contains applications that guarantee that you are the owner of the software and have the right to all of the accounting and key business functions . - ribbon technology removes the old " hunt and find " menu method ( although for those of us that took the time to memorize and learn the location of every buttom and drop-down it did take a day or two to get used to the new set up ) . - integration with the web and other programs is virtually seemless . - excel is no longer the chore it once was because of the above mentioned ribbon . - accounting software is included . - ink and crossword . i 'm not one for games on my business pc , but for anyone that likes to doodle or zone out with crosswords , ultimate lives up to its name by including an art program designed for pen users and excellent crosswords . - onenote . i like post-its ( perhaps a little too much *l* ) and always used the post-it note software on my business computer to keep notes . i used onenote 2003 sparingly because i simply found the post-it note software easier to use on my desktop , but...with my tablet pc one note 2007 added a new dimension to my notetaking that i feel will work well with my business : the earlier mentioned web and application integration and handwriting to text functionality . i may still use post-it now and then for quick notes or perhaps the windows " stickys , " but the long note pages , pasting of images and other web info , and pen to paper note taking makes this product invaluable . - word . what can i say ? this is my primary software tool and i use it on a tablet pc . the 2007 applications were made for my computer type . i can easily click on formatting tools with the touch of my wacom pen and i do n't have to stop mid-thought to make a change or wait until i finish the document to then make my edits . - powerpoint , publisher , access , groove , infopath et cetera ( also included ) : i am still delving into these , but they appear to have all of the perks of the other programs . so , did i have any dislikes ? 1. the ink program does n't respond to my wacom pen as well as the windows journal or microsoft onenote . it also does n't have easy to use tools within the software . since it was an " extra " and will not be my primary desktop publishing , design , or art tool - i 'll probably remove it at some point from my tablet . 2. microsoft does not include an instruction manual or reference book with this program . as a result , after installation of the first disk and microsoft 's statement that all of my programs were installed , i could n't find my accounting software , had no idea that the accounting software was on the second disk ( the second disk , when loaded , does n't mention that the software is on the disk until after the software installation is complete and instead mentions other business applications ) , and wasted over an hour trying to find it . also , i 'm a " hands on " person and although i have access to the internet whenever i need it , i enjoy having an actual book in my hands from time-to-time while learning . ultimate is made with enough simplicity that a manual is n't really necessary ( i.e. most questions can be answered by the " help " window ) , but...for the hefty price tag , i do n't think it would have been too much to ask microsoft to include a basic " this is how you install the programs and this is what to expect " booklet . also note : athough microsoft , through their downloads e-mail updates , provided a " getting started " tab with a " how-to " for each major software applications , the tabs had to be added " after the fact " and many of you might find yourselves frustrated with the lack of upfront instructions on how to use the software . beside those few quirks , i fully stand behind my 5 star rating of this product and purchasing this product through amazon ( i.e. amazon 's pricing was less than the big boy retailers or online vendors ) . shipping turnaround with super saver : 2 days . 
dvd neg 765.txt so this was the breakout movie for mira sorvino , the one that earned her an academy award for best supporting actress in 1995. this movie , and mira sorvino 's performance in it , was so bad that after it was over , i just had to find out who her competitors were for the 1995 best supporting actress category . let 's see.....according to wikipedia they were : kathleen quinlin ( " apollo 13 " - a fairly standard worried-wife-of-astronaut-in-danger role ) , mare winningham ( " georgia " - did not see this one ) , joan allen ( " nixon " - did not see , but how hard can it be to play the wooden pat nixon ? ) , and kate winslet ( " sense and sensibilities " - did not see either , but ang lee was robbed by the academy here also ) . it only proves just how few good roles there are for women in today 's hollywood that mira sorvino could win an oscar for this sort of performance . and i was beginning to warm up to her , too - she was great in " romy and michele 's high school reunion " , and terrific also in " beautiful girls " . so , what exactly is so bad about this movie ? here 's a brief list : 1. mira sorvino plays the entire movie in a high-pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking . another reviewer described this as similar to listening to fingernails on a blackboard . maybe in 1995 , because she was new , the academy did n't realize that this was n't her real voice and took pity on her... . 2. stupid plot device of the greek chorus . 3. stupid happy ending with a twist . 4. lots of profanity and dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in pornography movies.....while this movie is not itself a porn flick , the explicit details of the porn industry included in the dialogue definitely makes it not a movie for families to watch . 5. odd sight of a very old and wrinkly woody allen ( with dyed hair and bald spot ) making out with two women young enough to be his granddaughters.....all right , so i 'm just jealous - woody still looks gross... . 6. cliched , poorly developed characters , a plotline that goes around in circles , and lots and lots of pointless , unfunny dialogue . in summary , this movie is bad , bad , bad..... .

dvd pos 68.txt francis ford coppola 's apocalypse now is a pure example of method filmmaking . it is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker . the art direction , editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable . what drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline , acting and inner message . the inner message evidently enough is that war is hell , or in other words , hell is war . not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art . european filmmakers would n't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war . what is most interesting is that an american filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film 's collaborators through the continuance of the film . the plot is fairly simple and brief , adapted by joseph conrad 's heart of darkness . martin sheen plays the role of captain willard , a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore . he has a mission and it is to capture a presumed colonel kurtz ( marlon brando ) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the cambodian jungle . throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences . the most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks . robert duvall 's character colonel kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic american army brain : to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself . the children walk about the playground , oblivious to any danger . the helicopters come into view from the dawning sea ; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water , we hear the helicopter 's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack . throughout the sequence we hear wagner 's ' ride of the valkyries' . it is method filmmaking . the starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie ; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing . let 's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which sheen travels in , stop an innocent upcoming boat , suspecting them to be vietcongs and carrying artilleries . then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity . this film has its famous moment , some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen . it does n't require any intellectual understanding , although the film is intellectually remarkable . the american soldiers in the vietnam war jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country , aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against . it was a war gone mad , like all other wars , without purpose or dignity . it was a pure act of humanity : to destroy and restore their own greedy needs . this is a film in which there is no saviour , where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed , anger , foolishness and egoism . as coppola once said about the film : ' this film is n't about vietnam . this film is vietnam' . he was right to the date . during the current situations of the world , where they are trying to protect their own skin , the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent . it is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation . it asks for realism . enjoy

software pos 655.txt at home , i 've been a mac user since 1991. i also have been something of a linux fanatic too and have used several distros , mostly red hat and now fedora core . at work , however i have used ms-dos , windows 3.11 , 95 , 98 and xp . it 's fair to say i have never liked microsoft . but on a laptop i use at work ( an older gateway 400vtx with a 2.2ghz intel celeron ) , i just upgraded to vista home basic . i also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1gb . and despite my years of eschewing microsoft , guess what ? i must say i really like the os . it runs fine on my slower system and i had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers . i think microsoft has really made a " cool " os 
music pos 75.txt 1978 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of cleveland . just like their other fellow ohion 's devo , the guys in pere ubu obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.i have owned this recording in various formats since 1980 and i have never grown tired of this album . i find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years ago , if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and re-record it , it just would'nt happen . there is just a certain magic that they captured in 1978 , as to the music itself i tend to break - up this album into 2 distinct parts . side one being the more accessible " drunken " side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise , but a little too intelligent , just listen to the lyrics.side 2 is definately the " drug " side like a bad acid trip vocalist david thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of cleveland ( i have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric ) and the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going off in a million different directions.i could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize , experience and consume at your own leisure , and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album mean to you . so if you loved things like throbbing gristle 's song hamburger lady then u will surely love pere ubu 's album the mordern dance.as another reviewer mentioned before black francis of the pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guys.i also hear there influences in recent bands such as portishead and queens of the stone age just to name a few.so if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album , even if you have to beg , steal or borrow it .

books pos 657.txt ironweed by william j . kennedy was the latest selection for a book club i 've recently joined . the premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie ( at the group meeting ) that was based on the novel . as i expected , the movie paled in comparison to the book , despite the screenplay being written by kennedy himself . jack nicholson plays the main character ( francis ) and meryl streep is his " wanna be " socialite girlfriend ( helen ) , but this star power does n't elevate the story beyond what kennedy had already done in the novel . set during the " great depression , " ironweed is a great look at the underbelly of society : drunks , homeless , impoverished , and in that regard the story is timeless . i enjoyed the characters ' quirkiness and the loosely connected plots , but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption , forgiveness , and love . the love aspect may be hard to spot , but it is there , unconventionally , in many of the character 's interactions . this favorable recommendation comes with a warning : it can be a depressing read , definitely not a happy one , and while i found it inspirational , it will not conjure any blithe emotions . ironweed is definitely not a june beach read , being more apropos to a long winter night , indoor , by a warm fire . 
books pos 395.txt in all the talk about education issues these days , it 's easy to forget that what 's really important is the relationship , the energy , between students and teacher . when the teacher closes his door and is face-to-face with thirty kids- -that 's where it 's at . it 's not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum- -it 's what happens between people in a classroom . this book shows that dynamic relationship between eager , active kids and a caring , active teacher . it 's not all pleasant , and successes are sometimes small , but a pervasive caring underlies it all . as a teacher , this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing i can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork , go for a walk , go to bed early so i can be there for them the next day 
music pos 752.txt i am a latecomer to the works of chopin , unqualified to comment on dinu lipatti 's technique and interpretation , but this recording gives an interesting framework to explore the waltzes . they are numbered 1 through 14 in order of opus publication , but on this disc lipatti shuffles them to form a cycle of his own devising . there are four waltzes in the key of a flat and it seems one challenge was to space them across the recital . contrast this to alexandre thaurad 's cd where he clumps like-key waltzes into groups . ( he also adds five more posthumous works . ) most of chopin 's waltzes start on the dominant , meaning either the fifth note of the home key ( the tonic , the i ) , or a dominant seventh chord ( v7 ) which leads to the tonic . lipatti uses this feature to string together his cycle . if , for instance , there were a waltz that ended on a c natural it could easily bring us to waltz no 4 , which starts on an insistent c7 chord before rising to the home key of f major . i will use this as the starting point for tracing the harmonic relationships of the tracks on this cd . track 1 : waltz no 4 in f , " grande valse brillante " - as noted starts on the v7 and finishes on f in octaves . track 2 : no 5 in a flat - begins on a trilling dominant eb , but the note it trills up to is an f ( which ended the previous track ) . finishes with a parting shot , a turn in the bass ending on ab. track 3 : no 6 in d flat , " minute waltz " - starts on ab ; the contour of the opening phrase echoes the gesture of the previous parting shot as well . ends in db. track 4 : no 9 in a flat - has two pick up notes then hits a db on the downbeat of the first measure . the right hand ends on the ab above middle c . track 5 : no 7 in c sharp minor - starts on a g sharp above middle c , which is the same black key ( enharmonic equivalent ) of the previous ab. ends in c# minor . track 6 : no 11 in g flat - starts with a pick-up turn then hits the downbeat with a db ( enharmonic c# ) . ends on a gb in the treble clef . track 7 : no 10 in b minor - starts quietly on the same note , an f# ( enharmonic gb ) . ends with a soft b in the bass clef . track 8 : no 14 in e minor - first note is the exact same b in the bass . ends in e minor . track 9 : no 3 in a minor - starts on an e in the bass melody . ends in a minor ; keep in mind that minor third of this key is a c natural - - you can hear it in the melody of the third to last measure . track 10 : no 8 in a flat - this is a side-stepping change of keys , but there is an harmonic link to the previous waltz . instead of starting on the dominant , this one begins on the major third - - c natural . track 11 : no 12 in f minor - starts on the dominant - - c again . toggle back and forth between tracks 10 and 11 and you will hear that these two waltzes start on the exact same pitch . instead of ending in f minor this waltz closes in the relative major of ab. the last three notes are a rise and fall , bb-c-ab . track 12 : no 13 in d flat - there is a leading note before the dominant . the first three notes ( bb-ab-f ) fall and rise in a mirroring gesture to the final phrase of the previous . ends quietly in db. track 13 : no 1 in e flat , " valse brillante " - another side-stepping key change but there is a connection . if you toggle between tracks 12 and 13 you will hear the same initial note , a bb - - quietly in the former , boldly here . finishes resoundingly in the tonic eb. track 14 : no 2 in a flat , " grande valse brillante " - introduction in the dominant chord , eb7. closes in ab. from here you could loop around to the beginning of the cycle again , linking the major third ( c natural ) to the v7 that starts the f major waltz 
dvd neg 41.txt as part of my ongoing quest to catch up on comic book movies that i have missed over the past few years i came across this clunker . i understand , of course , that i am not the target demographic here . most comic book fans want nothing more out of their movies than authenticity ; unfortunately i was looking for an actual cinematic experience . four scientists go gallivanting around space with some chump named dr. von doom ( who wins the award for the most obvious name for a villain ever ) ; they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers ( now we 're talking ) thanks to some chemical filled cloud . what follows is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory in history . special effects pile on top of bad special effects as the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks show . we get the thing caving in the front of a semi-truck with his shoulder as the money shot , but it comes in the middle of a scene that left me mystified . an entire bridge and just about every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with their found powers . but since these are the good guys we have to watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered , and succeed . destruction for the fans , no consequences for the characters . but why would director tim story try anyways ? he knows the people are just showing up to ogle at jessica alba as she pretends to act . so instead of focusing on the story he focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product placements make it into the frame . he should have just directed a pepsi commercial with jessica alba and saved us the trouble of watching this mess . the plot is also outwardly defiant in its interest in being even a little entertaining . instead of watching good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble . they are n't even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the last fifteen minutes of the movie . they go out , show off their powers ( in things like extreme sports , you know , for the kids ) , and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough . there is also a lackluster love triangle between sue storm ( jessica alba ) , reed richards ( ioan gruffudd ) and dr. von doom ( julian mcmahon ) . i 'm sure it is real nice to believe that someone who looks like jessica alba would rather go out with a lowly scientist as opposed to the all powerful , all wealthy dr. von doom . but chances are if you 're chasing someone that looks like her she 's not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful career . so why is my rating so high above the zero i 've been talking it up to be ? well it is what it is . it did n't put me to sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly . it was fun watching tv actors such as michael chiklis and julian mcmahon try their luck at a hollywood blockbuster . and at least it was n't " catwoman . " but what it was was insulting . beyond the obvious point that nobody would believe jessica alba as a scientist lies another that shows just how stupid story thinks we are . at a newsstand , on the cover of people magazine there is a picture of sue storm . now if stephen hawkings ca n't make it to the cover of people then what chance does this two-bit scientist have ? **1 / 4 
music neg 738.txt first of all let me clearly state that im from atlanta and i am a diehard fan of lil scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this cd is garbage . besides money in the bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with dj don cannon early last year was on fire , he and cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point , that was of course before 50 's influence which brings us to our problem . the influence of curtis jackson a.k.a 50 cent is very clear on this album . i like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south . if the g-unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let scrappy pick and choose his own tracks , verses etc. everything may have been fine . the guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the " a " is pumping this and it is a shame because when scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable . this cd is garbage plain and simple and 50 's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south 's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise 's up . this is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.i have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he 's dropped but , im telling you if you the consumer buy this cd you will regret it and to scrappy ditch the g unit do what 's in your heart and get back to business . 
camera pos 794.txt i shot my second feature ( flying tiger ) on the dvx and took it to the cannes film fest market and no one could tell it was n't film . this camera is fantastic if you shoot right . i suggest this camera over all the other similarly-priced models . we have done extensive testing with many cameras and this is my favorite . the jvc is many thousands more and you get less grain with it in dark areas , true , but for the money , the dvx , if you shoot properly with it , will get you amazing results . for proof , you can check out footage shot in a ton of lighting conditions at my site . we had the best luck in natural light , with simple chimera diffusers . if you 're honest with yourself and do n't plan on hitting the lottery anytime soon ( getting a real distribution deal / full 35mm blowup ) and you need a good looking film for fests or dvd , there is no way you should shoot on film , or another camera . we shot a full feature on no money and had many distrib offers , all because of the look this camera gave us . i 'm planning on using it again for my next film . ! viva la revolucion ! put the dvx in 24p advanced mode and rip the knob off 
books neg 46.txt i was expecting this book to be a great story , but very disappointed . i cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is . the book is insipid and dull , has no flow , no story , or no plot . let me present an example . i have read many insightful newsweek articles by a writer allan sloan . for example , sloan describes a sprint merger event in this way , " if talk is getting cheaper , why did mci worldcom pay $115 billion to buy sprint ? the once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world . can regulators handle the complex new order.... . " it has a clear logical axis , and has a force to attract readers into it . but jeter describes it like this , " the merger announcement of worldcom and sprint spurred building activity around worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity . the real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit.... . " it always presents off-center , trivial detail which makes a reader bored . 70% of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact , like " the merger of company a & b raised the stock to $x " etc. there is no insight here . but unfortunately , unlike enron scandal , there is no other book that centered on the worldcom scandal . you would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in newsweek or business week , if you have lexisnexis or ebiscohost .

dvd neg 758.txt a french saying goes : " the more things change , the more they stay the same . " it appears that the " historical " epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that " poetic " license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth . one of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is d w griffith 's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth . firstly , we all know that this cameron dude did not start the kkk and that this organisation has its roots in indiana and not south carolina . secondly , the kkk is not the defender of the south and there is no need to " purify " the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by d w is " preserve the aryan race . " modern science , using cutting edge dna research has already proved that we all come from the same african man about 60 , 000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well . like it or not , we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor . some of the portrayals of blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys i found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie . yes , this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content ? this is not akin to an einstein discovering relativity folks ; every single " good " thing about this movie would have been " discovered / invented " with or without d w . eventually and very probably very soon after . every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later , talented directors of the time . the overall lies , attempts to justify racism and the murderous kkk more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie 's great hall of fame . they say that racists are not born but bred ; this is why i 'm not at all surprised at what d w griffith has done here . his father was considered a " hero " of the confederate army where he served as a colonel . i 'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war , he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist . this movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it 's quite irritating to have to keep hearing mendelssohn 's overtures over and over again . in conclusion , the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it 's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors ' world view ? also , do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that 's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message ? like i said before none of the " techniques " that this film claims to have " discovered " are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway . so the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good ; d w griffith 's legacy / mess

dvd neg 587.txt that 's all i could think of when my family and i sat down to watch this movie together . we had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in santa fe . the story itself is so powerful and moving . built in the 1870s , the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit . the sisters ' prayed a novena to st. joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived , built the " miraculous " staircase , and then disappeared without being paid . the staircase is a double helix with no visible support . it 's 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals , and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near santa fee ! this movie however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real resentment towards indians and also likes to curse ( how this has anything to do with the actual story i still have no idea ! ) . at one point when a nun is " shocked " to hear mother curse mother surperior responds " oh margret get off the cross and get down here with the rest of us " . when the mysterious carpenter shows up and starts to build the staircase , the architect and the contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill the carpenter . meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by " god " builds the staircase with wood that does n't work , is arrested after being falsly accused of attempted murder , and leaves everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better . in the end the staircase is built and this mother superior ( who is on death 's door ) is so moved that she literally crawls up the staircase in a very " weird " / " uncomfortable " scene until she reaches the choir loft and dies . wow , inspiring . the best thing i could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and moving story and turned it into a hollywood flop . this was obviously written , directed , and produced by people who have no idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it was n't a miracle because hey , miracles just do n't happen . the acting was pretty good but the story was junk . unfortunately i bought this movie . if you are looking for a true inspirational movie that you can watch with your family , rent or buy mother theresa with olivia hussey . hands down the best saints movie every filmed . half way through the movie my 5 year old says out loud " wow , she really cares about everybody ! " inspirational movie , compared to this disappointment 
dvd pos 513.txt truth be told , i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively . when this thing gets going , though , the descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status , and on top of all the incredible special effects , oppressive atmosphere , and grievous bloodletting ( made with a pretty limited budget , by the way ) , one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner . are you kidding me ? blood , gore , a claustrophobic atmosphere like you would n't believe - and subtlety ? how could i not give the descent five stars ? so you 've got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky , extreme activity . white water rafting , for example . everyone has fun , but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women , sarah ( shauna macdonald ) , forever . still recovering from her terrible loss , sarah joins her friend beth ( alex reid ) in america , where mutual friend juno ( natalie mendoza ) , an alpha female if there ever was one , has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored . joining in the fun are holly ( nora-jane noone ) , juno 's new gung-ho sidekick , and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet . the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians ( apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk ) , then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure . once they descend into the cave system , though , things start getting more intense fairly quickly . their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal , especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses . that 's when juno , a woman with more than her fair share of secrets , admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before , supposedly to help reunite the group . well , it does just the opposite , but they just have to keep going . if there is a way out , they 're going to have to find it the hard way . things are already creepy enough at this point . the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets , making the viewer feel as if he / she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters . just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight , dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic . but the real fun was just about to begin . in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you 'll ever want to squirm through , sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them . no one believes her - at first . when the " crawlers " attack , though , all hell breaks loose two miles under ground . these gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind , albino humanoids who hunt by sound , can scamper and climb like monkeys , move unbelievably quickly , and really tear into whatever flesh they can find . not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves , the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light . and when the girls fight back , it 's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy , bloody , gruesome department . and even as characters are fighting for their lives , a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher . the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences did n't get to see the true final scene of the film , for some pretty questionable reasons . a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference . do n't worry , though , as the dvd has both endings available . the descent draws deeply from the well of man 's most instinctual fears , making it one of the most atmospheric , heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while . the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here . the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that . if you care the first thing about horror , you must see this atmospheric tour de force

books pos 323.txt addressing as it does issues of cognition , language usage and acquisition , evolutionary biology and innate versus learned behavior , this work is relevant to many of the great intellectual debates of our time . it is very readable for the most part , although if some of the topics are new to you then you will find a few sections rather heavy going . more illustrations would have helped here . there are syntax structure diagrams and one very grudging , cursory sketch of the language centers of the brain , but many sections cry out for a diagram among all the verbiage . pinker 's lively , humorous style is often commented on but i sometimes found it wearing . he will illustrate a point with an amusing newspaper cutting , then list a few more , then add " i could not resist some more.. . " and so on . i sometimes wished he would just get on with it . a major problem with his nativist approach , which other reviewers have commented on , is that many examples he lists of usages that english speakers would never employ are nothing of the kind . most of them are conceivable and since the first publication of this book , linguists have been busy recording them in the field . the thesis also becomes somewhat unraveled in the penultimate chapter , where he argues that ' you and i ' and ' you and me ' are equally correct in all circumstances , because ' the pronoun is free to have any case it wants' . but if this is so then what has become of the innate awareness of correct usage that the whole theory is about ? if ' between you and i ' sounds instinctively wrong to me and ' between you and me ' sounds instinctively wrong to someone else , does that mean one of us has a mutant grammar gene ? i doubt it . the title itself is problematic . ' instinct ' is not a word much in favor among biologists nowadays and whatever language is , it is certainly not instinctive in the traditional sense . early in the book , pinker admits as much , but determines to use the word anyway , a use that owes more to marketing than to science . still , this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently available . if you are new to linguistics , start here rather than with chomsky , but please go on to read geoffrey sampson 's work , perhaps starting with his website , to get an alternative view . as with most academic disputes , the answer no doubt lies somewhere in the middle . since chomsky 's early work , the nativists have toned down their claims considerably , while their opponents have made concessions . on page 34 of this book , pinker says , " no one has yet located a language organ or a grammar gene , but the search is on . " more than a decade later , the search is still on . good luck with that .

health neg 78.txt although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions .

health pos 362.txt my bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and , being a light sleeper , i 've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber . it does n't help that my husband ( god love him ) snores as loud as a small jet plane . i 've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like i have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light . i received the tranquility zone eye mask for a birthday present and i could hardly wait to try it . i love this thing ! it 's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and , due to the design , the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears . the sounds are pleasant ( i 'm a big fan of the " babbling brook " track ) and i love being able to plug my mp3 player in so i can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks , too . i 've given this 5 stars because there 's no option for 4.5. in all honesty , there are a few drawbacks . first , when i say this is thick i 'm not kidding . without my a / c in the summer it might get a bit warm . second , the sound clips themselves are on very short loops.. . so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you 're hearing you 'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so . were it not for this i 'd be a bigger fan of the first track - - the one that sounds like you 're in a forest - - but i get distracted ( and awakened ) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades . even with these things in mind , i have to say i have n't slept this well in years . i love this thing , and i wish i 'd found it earlier . in fact , i love it so much i 've given it as a gift to two friends who 'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it , too

music pos 972.txt this collection of italian cello sonatas by the great janos starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums i own . the world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist stephen swedish on five of the selections , and by his frequent collaborator gyorgy sebok on the bach sonata in g minor , which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length ( it is a welcome addition musically too ) . the selections here range from famous composers like bach , boccherini and vivaldi , to the lesser known corelli , locatelli and valentini . for me , the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of starker . whether it is the happy bounce of the vivaldi allegro , the sublime rendering of the boccherini adagio , or the precise interplay with sebok on the bach sonata , starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich , full sound by the mercury living presence recording technique . this is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts

books neg 508.txt i 'm a wiccan who formally practices within a traditional gardnerian coven , but practices eclectically within my private practice . i read this book because i had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a christian ; purportedly , wicca 's charm was written by an impartial writer . immediately , you realize that this is n't true . catherine sanders has a clearly stated agenda : that wiccans are simply misguided and misunderstand that what they long for is offered by christianity . i could write a long review debating the merits of sanders ' arguments . instead , i suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which sanders claims to have thoroughly researched . she relies on the writings of margot adler , carol christ , starhawk and phyllis curott ( with barely a nod to scott cunningham and ronald hutton ) to draw many of her conclusions . yet , missing from her notes are such writers as the farrars , merlin stone , raymond buckland , isaac bonewits , patricia crowley , and the matthews , to name just a few outstanding contributors to neopaganism 's base of knowledge . too often , sanders relies on the statements of young wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive . in another case , she bases her thesis that women 's spirituality ( e.g. , goddess worship ) is misguided and that christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via one speech that she heard margot adler give shortly after 9 / 11. sanders requests both christians and neopagans to read her book with an open mind . a fair request . but as you 're reading , closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind , or whether sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that christianity has everything that a wiccan desires . one needs to go no further than to consider that as sanders attempts to persuade the reader that christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of paul .

dvd neg 400.txt i had high hopes for this series when i started watching it , though i guess the nonstop obscenities should have been the tip off that under all of that visual masterwork and spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked an twisted message that wasted ten hours of my life to discover . shandala is truly a wonderful character , pure and good , and the characterization of her is very tender , so by episode 21 or so the storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful and uplifting . oh , how wrong of me to think so , because for all of the philosophical and religious trappings , the message of " hope " the marketers promise is that the characters learn in the end that the villain 's demented plan to save the world is really more effective than their spiritualities and that the " truth " is that the emotional and physical torture and destruction of an innocent , good woman is the only way to save the world ! spare me . and if you think that i am disgusted by this message , just imagine what the muslims will think when they see what becomes of all of that quoting of the koran and the muslim character 's final opinions . although the story is technically good , i 'm only giving it one star for the message of despair .

considerable critical acclaim , she should be correcting and grading ( failing ) garbage like this not producing it . so what went wrong ? how did this novel end up so awful ? the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece . there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things . length : if " brevity is the soul of wit " , this novel 's witlessness is easily explained . at 666 pages ( interesting number that ) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been . it would seem that , to some extent like melville before her , naslund confused length with importance , but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is . imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody . somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel , but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing.. . with a meat axe or a chainsaw . the name dropping : one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures , but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend . they are badly handled here . an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century new england and those she does n't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund 's peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne . one or two of these , developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude . as it is , it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor ( or the self-awareness ) . the politics : even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel , so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing . however , naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day ( and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day ) from slavery to whaling , from feminism to free love , from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled , all without consequence or even criticism . this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves . una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today , which is to say : none . the anti-christian bigotry : there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time , but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted . it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish , the bigoted , the future apostate , or the mentally ill . it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time except christianity . the farfetched scenarios : i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter... . after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic . after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her ( a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand ) , una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle , encounters two young men who both fall in love with her , disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them , successfully avoids detection , is sunk by a whale , survives by committing cannibalism , marries the surviving young man after he goes insane , and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians , leaving her free to " marry " captain ahab ( una never really " marries " anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes ) . things do n't get more realistic in the second half , which includes una 's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale . riiiight . the mary sue : however , the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a " mary sue " that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader . a more realistic main character might have saved it . una never learns anything from her life 's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything . she does n't change because she is already perfect . she does n't have to deal with the criticism of others because she does n't receive any , and she does n't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides , una had her reasons ( and they were very good ones you can be sure ) . the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it . i feel like i 've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom.. . with the door locked . 
music neg 628.txt imagine buying this cd after seeing " the mirror has two faces " fully expecting the soundtrack music to the movie , and reading overall great reviews on amazon . imagine the shock of receiving the cd and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - the remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse . perhaps barbara , with her tremendous unlimited wealth , felt she would be giving away a " free album " to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film . shameless misrepresentation 
health neg 557.txt the reviewer who compared the massage feature to that of a cell phone perhaps said it best , so suffice it to say that one can essentially ignore that aspect of the unit [i might even liken the vibrations to those of an injured ( and no longer airborne ) housefly buzzing in circles]. with respect to the heat ( ing ) , it does perform better , but is by no means stellar . the pro 's are its design for moisture , a better-than-average fabric / material - which holds its shape fairly well and the auto shut-off . the con 's include , as others have said , a huge ac-dc plug / power pack , no apparent ability to wash the darn thing , only modest heat , annoying velcro straps , a two-part power cord that not only must be taped to keep together , but ca n't be removed from the main pad for washing and , perhaps most significantly , the fact that mine died after approx . 18 months ( which , incidentally , raises yet another detractor ; the warranty is only a year , much less than many other brands )

music neg 468.txt yes yes we all know the mega hit when i see you smile . but it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole . the band hits gear pretty early with best of what i got but after that it 's pretty bad . how possession ever became a hit i 've not idea . well , where i come from it did n't , but in the us this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits . the production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album . neil schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80 's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck . besides , he probably wanted some revenge on steve perry so he really wanted to make some cash . pity , listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man . rockin ' horse for example . an interesting additin to the aor landscape , and some of the music is lively . but when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just does n't get my vote . even my devoted aor fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track ( we all know which one ) . but hey , if aor is your bag you could do a lot worse

dvd neg 260.txt i saw this movie and was shocked at the contents , considering that it was aimed at children . it starts out with the gypsy esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance . while no stripping happened , there was n't much other difference in the style of dance . later in the movie , one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner i would never want my children to see . he sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he does n't have her , and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire . regardless of the rest of the movie , these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children . not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel , which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one .

" soul trains a comin " ( although not a chart hit ) was missing . i would perfer the original version than the 12 inch version used for soul train from seasons 13 - " maria " ( a lackluster lp track from his latest lp , surrender ) should have been replaced with the beautiful " together always " ( from his proper sophmore lp , you & i ) . the horrible and silly " drivin ' force " ( also from surrender ) should have been out ! " lovelite " , " you & i " and " i 'm freaky " lp versions should have been on there instead of the 45 versions because they stood out very well ! ! " is this for real , " right from the start , " and " love has found its way . " were the other great ballads and jams that were non-singles but were gems as well . the absense of " soul trains a comin ' ( original ) " , " together always " , and full versions of " you & i " , " i 'm freaky " , and " lovelite " really knocked off 3 points from best of o'bryan cd and should be made into a redo ! ! for those that wasted thier money on this , " go on and cry " because right stuff records done ripped y'all off ! ! this underated talented artist ( good singer , writer , producer , and instrumentalist ) was trying to be the next prince and michael jackson but he was considered more like a 1980s version of carl thomas ( too soulful for the mainstream ) . people must have bought this cd ( if do not have original lps no more ) because more than half of the tracks are not available on other cds . i admit i love all the songs from the cd ( except for maria and driving force ) , but i will create a new cd under my productions , soul train alumni series along with my own compilations of shalamar , jermaine stewart , pebbles , jody watley and other soul train almumnis . 1. soul trains a comin ' ( original although i love the remix ; loved the keyboard fanfare on the intro ) 2. the gigolo 3. still waters 4. right from the start ( great track and catchy hooks ! ! ) 5. i 'm freaky ( full lp verison , the keyboard solo was missing from the 45 single 4 minute version ) 6. you & i ( full original lp version . loved the closing ) 7. together always ( o showed his true feelings on this 1983 track ) 8. lovelite ( full original lp version - lovelite baby ! ! ) 9. breakin ' together ( good effort and loved the video ! ! ) 10. go on & cry ( good ballad ) 11. lady i love you ( what ever happened to lovin ' your woman and tellin ' her how you feel . this was his best ballad ever and this should school young catz like bobby valentino and r kelly on real love . ) 12. you 're always on my mind ( i 'm glad they included this lp track from 1984 's be my lover on the compilation and would be good for the redo . beautiful ballad that shows a woman on how you feel although she 's seeing someone else ) . 13. tenderoni ( 45 single , i never actually heard of the full lp track before but it was a good pre-new jack single ) 14. is this for real ( great ! ! ! ) 15. you have got to come to me ( beautiful new jack ballad that should have made the charts ) this here is the real best of o'bryan plus more . wish i can add more like " i 'm in love again " , " doin ' alright " , " surrender " " love had found its way " and " shake " but had to pick the best 16 that would fit ! ! - - thank you ! !

camera pos 758.txt shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways , but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability , which , to me , is absolutely awful ! personally , i hate zoom lenses . i 've got a full set of nikon primes . and while i 'd prefer a prime lens , these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr . i like this lens because it goes wide on digital . i suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it 's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives . for anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end , unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time , 2mm is a significant difference in field of view on short lenses . as the focal length increases ( eg , from 400mm to 600mm ) , the difference in angle of view is not very large . but the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though " only 2mm " is no laughing matter , and if you do n't believe me , you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself . if you end up deciding to get a 12mm , you want to buy the sigma 12mm ( i think it is 12-24mm ? ) because that lens covers full 35mm frame ( and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing ) ! also , if sigma or nikon reads this review , please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime ! and if sigma reads this review , i want some f1.2 or f1.0 afd primes ! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length ! i would definitely buy ( full frame coverage of course ) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele ! neither nikon nor canon makes anything like that ( well , canon kind of does / did ) , so you 'd have the market segment dominated

dvd pos 221.txt i lived through the vietnam era . if you did you ca n't ever forget . this guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us . here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong , why it went wrong and what we can learn to keep from repeating it . for me , here was the most unforgettable moment . decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days . macnamara tells him we- -the americans- -were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism , seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china . the north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said , " mr. macnamara , you must have never read a history book ! we 've been fighting the chinese for a thousand years ! we are n't their puppet ! we were fighting for our national freedom ! we would have fought to the last man ! " macnamara says they almost came to blows . here 's the point . macnamara says , as compared to say the soviets , we did n't understand the north vietnamese . we did n't really know enought about them . we had no idea what was in their minds . and that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons ! that 's why we lost ! does any of this sound familiar ? ? ? ? ? ? this is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age . it 's that good and that informative . of course , it wo n't be widely viewed by the american public . we 'll go our goofy way coveting our big-screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things- -like sporting events

camera pos 124.txt i started with a d50 and have loved it from the very begining . i felt ready to step up to the next level , but did n't think i was ready for the d200. when i heard about the d80 , i read everything i could . the biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body . i do n't use all of the mode setting and find myself in shutter and aperture priority most of the time , but it 's nice to have the others there when i do n't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings . the in camera image enhancements are amazing- -but a word of caution . vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots- -if not too much so . i 've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years . compared to the canon 30d ( which i was thinking about ) or even the new 400d ( i have n't actually held one yet ) , this is the nikon to have . on batter life , i had a recent shoot where i took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period . the battery was at about half and that 's with quite a bit of lcd viewing . at this level both canon and nikon offer great equipment- -you ca n't go wrong with either . just get one of each in your hands , snap a few shots , and go with the one that feels the best for you

camera pos 136.txt i just bought a digital rebel about a month ago . love the camera , my old 380ex speedlight integrates with the camera but just does n't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the rebel . this flash does the job for the rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab that item . another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash , is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital rebel lacks . when this flash is mounted on your digital rebel , you do n't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash . the rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550ex to focus the lens ; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs . the flash has tons of features that most of us might never use , but as a advanced amateur i 'm glad they 're there so i can play with that if i should choose to try out some fancy stuff . the wireless slave capability is handy but you 've got to have at least one more 420ex , 550ex or 580ex to use that . i like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head , it 's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up / down- --this should make the head sturdier than i 've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts . this unit is a honker- -really big , and , no lightweight either . get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you . what 's the difference between this and the 580ex ? the 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes , for me anyway it was n't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580. all of the newer eos camera bodies are fully supported by this unit , it also works on older eos bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that are n't there on older stuff . i like this flash it covers well , cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use . when you get yours do n't lose that book , canon does n't seem to have them online anywhere i can find and i 've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one

books neg 727.txt as a dad , i was really looking forward to a book on potty training to help me with my 2-year old . this book is lousy though . why ? 1. stupid writing . i got pretty sick of constantly reading all the sappy , " witty " remarks . " dancing the potty mambo " ? give me a break ! 2. stupid advice . this book keeps telling you to talk to your kid like he / she is an adult . i 'm sorry , but a 2-year-old just cannot comprehend a long drawn-out explanation of why you want them or do n't want them to do something . how about just saying , " do n't do that ! " or " hey , you want to try this ? " that seems to work just fine for me . why give your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do something ? what 's wrong with just telling your kid what to do ( nicely ) , and expecting them to be obedient ? 3. repeating content . this book kept repeating itself over and over . okay , i got it already ! i strongly feel that the author wanted to push this book over the 200-page mark when all that needed to be said could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages ( or less ) . 4. too many references . this book constantly refers to other chapters . i once counted 6 different references to other chapters on one page . i am not kidding ! huh ? is potty training really that freakin ' complicated ? all i want is some general ideas on how to go about it , how to get started , and a few good tips . i do n't need all these detailed references . ( nor do i need the phrase " potty mambo " repeated to me ad infinitum . ) here is all i wanted to know : -how do i get started ? -what do i do ? -how often do i need to try it ? -should i go for pullups or just keep him in diapers for the moment ? maybe this book got to all of that , but i quit after page 60. i just could n't take it anymore . after hearing the phrases " stay positive " and " potty mambo " repeated to me for the umpteenth time , i had to quit . i returned this book and got my money back . if i were to say anything good about this book , i would say that it has a few good tips , surrounded by about 180 pages of filler . potty training still looms ahead . will i be successful ? probably . but to this book i say , no thanks 
software pos 886.txt coreldraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small " mom and pop " screenprinting shop i worked at . back then , corel came with oodles of free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not to mention free technical support via a toll-free number . i stayed with corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs and the dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " did it " for me . industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into adobe illustrator . being already familiar with adobe photoshop 's features , tools and " look and feel " , illustrator did n't present a huge , overbearing learning curve . in illustrator , i found the same robust features as coreldraw ... which was n't what impressed me about illustrator . adobe 's intuitive programs , and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... that is what won me over to illustrator . illustrator 's ability to edit / create pdf 's in their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files to photoshop ... with layers intact ? ? ? wow ! ! ! ( i could go on ) now , that being said ... there are still things that i prefer in coreldraw compared to illustrator . the extrude function in corel is much easier to utilize . the powerclip function is more user friendly than illustrator 's " make clipping mask " function . the ability to customize / edit / add shortcut keys is an amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on ) in regards to importing and exporting files from other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts a robust set of import and export filters , my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves during the import . this is a must have if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack . if i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into illustrator with fonts blown out ... i 'd be independently wealthy . why illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me . so , to sum it up ... coreldraw is a great program ... but i ca n't imagine it being my only vector drawing program . just like in real life , you need a great team . this program , paired with adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly .

software pos 167.txt this is a good software for casual use ( hiking , biking , geocaching ) , but not without issues . on the positive side , it definitely beats all non-digital ( scanned usgs maps ) alternatives . the level of details is good enough ( how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet ? ) . the fact that maps are digitally generated ( with vectors i believe ) makes all the labels clear at any scale . it has two advantages over its main " digital " competitor , ng topo . first , all of the us is on one dvd for the price of separate state / region cds from ng . and second , it is available . i could not even find ng 's northeast edition anywhere on the web ! one might think nh and me are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations . now the few negatives . the exchange feature with gps is flaky . sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my garmin . part of it could be that low and mid range gps still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with com-to-usb adapter ( beats me why garmin ca n't make all their gps with usb in this day and age ) . in any case , regardless of whose fault it is , it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly . the second problem i noticed was with the 3-d window . it clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if i do a lot of rapid rescaling . i ended up just closing that window , since it is pretty much for " coolness " and does not add any real topographical value . finally , i had a problem with delorme 's service . i purchased it from amazon with a rebate offer . however , a month after submitting the necessary info i received a card from delorme stating that the bar code i sent was not a upc code . the box only had one bar code on it so i am not sure how i could have made a mistake . they requested that i send a correct one , but with the code cut out and gone , how do they expect me to come up with one ? ! i feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it . i would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem .

music pos 381.txt the progressive metal world better wake up and take note of this outstanding band that hails from poland . these guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the past few years . so what do we get for our money you ask , a band comprising of well-schooled musicians , incredible song writing skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and time-passages into each song . there are a few scatterings of influences that are n't a major detraction from the overall mood of the album , namely dream theater , pink floyd , porcupine tree , genesis and anathema . the vocals are clean without a trace of an accent , however they get getting slightly gruff in places but this only compliments the smooth flow of the music . the guitar work is outstanding and david gilmour from pink floyd is a strong reference point here . the rhythm section is outstanding ; especially the drumming and the keyboards give the album a fuller sound with out being too over powering . if you want to start 2007 on a good note then riverside is a worthy investment for sure .

books pos 784.txt moral consciousness and communicative action is the primary anglophone source for habermas 's writings on & quot ; discourse ethics . &quot ; written in the early eighties , this translation , which was published in 1990 , provides a developmental perspective . the focus of the essays moves from habermas 's statements about the role of philosophy today , in & quot ; philosophy as stand-in and interpeter , to his writing on reconstructive social science in general , to his program for a discourse ethics in particular . the final papers address criticisms of this program . the volume suffers a bit from the fact that thomas mccarthy 's introduction is keen to locate habermas 's position vis a vis various contemporary moral-philosophical standpoints , but does not go very far toward locating the whole initiative in the broader canvas of habermas 's overarching social-theoretic project

camera neg 685.txt the me-1 provides a modest 1.2x magnification for viewfinders on olympus 's e-300 and e-500 cameras . ideally , this would allow sharper manual focusing and more precise framing . unfortunately , this did not happen when i used the me-1 to make a number of trial images with my e-500 , so i will be returning the me-1 for a refund . ( for the record , i wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting , with my " shooting eye " corrected to 20 / 20 vision . ) like other folks , i find the e-500 viewfinder a trifle small so that it 's not always easy to frame a shot and see exposure data at the same time . the camera must also be pressed against your face when framing , which is not always comfortable . in some ways , the me-1 created more problems than it solved . the me-1 kept the camera further from my face ( though it seemed to bump harder against my glasses ) , but at the cost of *narrowing* my angle of vision in the viewfinder . divide the viewfinder into four equal columns and rows so you have eight squares . the four squares in the middle of the viewfinder were easily visible , but those along the sides , top , and bottom were *less* visible than before , the corners considerably less . to frame a shot , i had to move my eye around the viewfinder much more with the me-1 than without it . to see exposure data , i had to shift my eye almost completely away from the image . more hassle than i need when shooting in the field . fortunately , there is another option that works for me . the e-300 and e-500 come with an ep-5 eyecup , which is definitely too small for my taste . but a larger eyecup is also available , the ep-6. the ep-6 keeps the camera a little further from my face . and with the viewfinder diopter properly adjusted ( a critical step no one seems to mention ) , the ep-6 allows me to see both the entire image and exposure data without shifting my eye very much at all . all of this will vary from person to person , of course , and there may be circumstances when the me-1 is exactly what 's needed - - so two rather than one star . but not in standard shooting conditions , especially if you need to compose , set exposure , and shoot quickly 
dvd pos 784.txt this is a film like none other you have ever seen , and as such you 'll either love it , or hate it . from the " reviews " posted on amazon , i 've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who do n't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it . this film is not literal . learn to *think* about what you are watching . to interpret archetypes , symbolism and metaphor . a clue : the lady character is named story . now why might that be ? and why would she require a vessel before taking flight into the world ? and what precisely does the wolf-like scrunt represent ? and why are there three of those monkeys ? this film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world . if you are n't an artist , you probably wo n't get it at all , and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this . but that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says , and love every beautiful , unique and visionary second of it . magical .

music pos 167.txt wow ! there 's sooooo.. . much to like in this album it 's amazing . the music is mostly upbeat & very catchy- -making you want to ( & will if no one 's around ) sing along . the lyrics are fine , meaningful , & personally touching- -about life which is getting faster & faster in the contemporary world , while people are still people with hopes , feelings , needs , desires , & all the rest of what makes people human . the lead singer , jennifer nettles is powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice ( though a bit twangy in style ) . she grabs you quickly for a wild ride- -immersing the listener in the musical story she 's telling . i bought the cd based on hearing baby girl & something more ( on the tv show vegas of all place ) . then i heard sugarland on the cma show- -winning awards as they so deserve . the range & variety of the songs on the album are good too- -from sweet & poignant ballads to wild & spicy soaring . virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to & the majority could become successful singles . yes , the style is their own mixture of influences- -the 3 artists come from different musical backgrounds , which makes their wonderful blending are the more impressive . and , the trio wrote all the songs on the cd- -with hall the primary author ( solo writer on one of them ) . how many trios are there with 2 women & 1 man ? i wonder if they are unique ? well , they are unique even if not in that respect- -how many bands include a mandolin ? . of course , country purists may not be happy with them , but the vast majority of listeners are . this has become one of my favorite albums , at the speed of sound . imho , it 's terrific

music neg 823.txt the lady can sing , but her " christian " message is compromised because of her part in " chasing papi " , where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage . it 's " crystal clear " to me that jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part . it 's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee , much in the same way that stacie orrico is now becoming.....and is it just me , or is it coincidence that these two womens ' album covers look strikingly similar ? it appears their paths in life are similar , too : compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart . as with a recent review of orrico that i made , i 'll give jaci velasquez her due : she can sing , and what i mean by that is sing the roof off of a house ! this album was excellent.....was . now , whenever i think or hear of jaci velasquez , i can only think one word : hypocrite

health pos 862.txt i found this product after reading a review of it on hairboutique.com . the length of my hair seemed to have reached a plateau just below my shoulders and after year seemed to have grown no longer . i decided to try this product to see if it worked . as hair growth is normally clocked at an 1 / 8 of an inch per month , i decided to monitor the results in my own little " clinical test . " this was actually pretty easy because i colour my hair so i 'd easily be able to see how much growth there was each month . i ordered a box of viviscal for which i paid $49 for ( average price on the web ) and the was set to take the first pill the following morning ( the box recommends 2 per day ) . i coloured my hair the night before so that in one month i 'd be able to accurately measure how much growth there had been by looking at the growth since the colouring . results : i did n't really notice anything until around the 2 week time frame . i noticed my nails were growing very fast / very long . i have weak nails that split easily and they barely seem to grow at all . it was very noticeable because i use the computer all day and the nail growth was causing my fingers to constantly slip on the keyboard . never having great nails , i was pretty happy to see this . my curiosity was also getting the better of me as i could see the roots of my hair pretty clearly which was unusual at 2 weeks after coloring . i took the tape measure and measured almost 1 / 4 of an inch in hair growth . this would mean 1 / 2 inch per month and 6 inches per year . i was pretty excited because although the numbers seemed small , it was twice the rate my hair normally grows . but i also noticed something else . my hair was becoming unusually greasy . because i have very dry hair , i normally only wash it 2-3 times a week . but every other day it seemed much more greasy than normal . hmmm. well , at the 1 month time frame i measured my hair growth and it was exactly 3 / 4 of an inch . not only that but i was constantly trimming my nails at this point . i was totally ecstatic . but also by this point , i was washing my hair every day - it was no longer dry and brittle , it was much softer , but there was no way i could miss a day of washing it or it would be greasy . so - the conclusions i have reached from my test was this : 1. yes , viviscal works . it caused my hair growth to be stimulated at over twice the speed . 2. viviscal also makes your nails much stronger and grow much faster . 3. viviscal makes your hair greasy , causing you to have to wash it every day - and then it 's fine . it did not cause any extra hair growth anywhere else , which i thought a bit strange ( though good ! ! ! ) . i recommend this product

dvd pos 477.txt jean renoir 's masterpiece , ' the grand illusion ' , is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal theme , something we can all understand and relate to . the triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times , is kind of an ironic theme considering hitler 's imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history . nevertheless , jean renoir 's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films . it is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb - jean gabin is one of the all time great actors. . jean renoir 's innovative approach would influence countless directors to come , including orson welles. . criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd - also worth getting is ' the rules of the game ' jean renoir 's greatest satire 
camera neg 224.txt i purchased this for my 4 year old son because he loves to take pictures . i did n't want to spend a lot of money , however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use . not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working . however , when it did work every single picture was blurry . there is only one button for every option and it is very confusing . i would n't recommend this product to anyone . it is being returned 
camera neg 165.txt after reading the many good reviews here , i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera . i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted . the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem . this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day ( with the lenmar battery in ) and suddenly the screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried to take was black . i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees . once the camera cooled it worked again for a while , but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , was it the lenmar battery 's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry ? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day ? i ca n't say for sure , but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day ( e.g. use the viewfinder , not the lcd since that generates heat , or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots ) .

dvd neg 894.txt hypocrisy alert ! hypocrisy alert ! i just wanted to get that out of the way right at the start . not more than twenty-four hours ago i wrote a review waxing philosophic on the state of the modern horror film . i argued that fans should n't viciously tear apart every movie they find objectionable because the current spate of horror films is better than no horror films at all . in other words , we should accept the bad with the good rather than stop renting and thus face a potential drought of horror movies . now that i have gotten that out of the way , i shall proceed to trash " adam & evil . " i did n't set out to heap scorn on this film when i popped it in the dvd player a few weeks ago , although a cursory glance at the cover art sent a chill of disappointment through my body and i felt my heart sinking . in fact , nothing screams " straight to video " more loudly than a film entitled " adam & evil . " well , perhaps something like " adam & the bollweevil , " or even " adam & evil knievel " might rank as likelier candidates , but you get the idea . " adam & evil " does not inspire confidence that i 'm about to watch a slasher film on par with carpenter 's " halloween . " right from the start of the film we learn the filmmakers have cast us into the ninth circle of clichéd slasher film hell . the movie introduces us to the typical bunch of young airheads getting ready to embark on a camping trip out in the sticks . there is seth ( kevin robson ) , the goofy virgin who tries too hard with the ladies but hopes that the trip will finally cure him of his unwanted condition . then there is the snotty and narcissistic brunette yvonne ( erica cerra ) . next up is a staple of every poorly made horror film , the ever important " loud guy " matt ( brody harms ) . along for the ride are evelyn ( barbara kottmeier ) , adam himself ( sean arnfinson ) , adam 's girlfriend yvette ( lynsey brothers ) , and a few other kids . i am willing to bet that as you look at this list you will notice the eve connotation in the three girls ' names , and that seth is also a name pulled straight out of the old testament . where matt comes in is a mystery unless we look to the new testament . something tells me the matthew responsible for the gospel did n't go around announcing to everyone who would listen that he wanted to be known as " matt . " call it a gut feeling . anyway , these dolts head out to the forest for a few fun filled days of gossip , drinking , and romping around in the water . sounds familiar , does n't it ? see those bright objects moving in your peripheral vision ? they 're called red flags . things get a little tense when they stop off at a local bar populated with the usual hollywood redneck stereotypes in order to ask some questions only to discover that the locals , with the exception of the busty wife of the local sheriff , are n't interested in helping out . too , a creepy park custodian stumbles into the campground and gives everyone a scare before scurrying back into the forest . if you think we 'll see him again before the credits roll , that 's one bet i wo n't take . i should also mention a couple of other potential stresses facing the group . adam and his friend matt did something quite idiotic a few years before- -namely setting a house ablaze with fireworks that claimed the lives of the family living there- -that continues to haunt them to this day . too , one of the gals worries about a stalker boyfriend she recently broke up with . both of these scenarios serve to provide us with potential red herrings in order to make the film more suspenseful . i laugh defiantly at such nonsense . i wo n't spoil the ending for you , but i will take a few seconds to describe the incredibly banal lead up to the " twist " ending . for a slasher film , " adam & evil " is downright puritanical with the red stuff . i felt like a bizarro clara peller hollering , " where 's the gore ? " every time a killing went down . seth , for example , perishes in his tent in a particularly bloodless , off camera fashion . a couple of the other kids meet their maker when they run into the killer while floating around on a raft in a pond , again a rather bloodless affair . the presence of a bow and arrows and a shed full of sharp instruments promised great things- -a promise unfulfilled , unfortunately . " adam & evil " is one of the tamest slashers i have ever seen . what did they do , turn the script over to the hayes commission before shooting scenes ? note to aspiring filmmakers : if you 're going to make a low budget slasher film that will never see a theatrical release , go over the top with the sauce . at least then you 've got a shot at making a cult classic . and another thing : make sure you pick people with a modicum of acting skills instead of the mannequins posing as living beings in this film . sure , you 'll have to shell out a few more bucks , but it 's worth it . remember , unless i 'm laughing so hard at the bad acting that the film achieves the coveted " so bad it 's good " label , ham handed performances can only hurt you . surprisingly , the dvd comes with a commentary track . not that you 'll want to listen to it , but there it is . we also get a few trailers for three other schlock films : " contagion , " " hallow 's end , " and " asylum days . " forget about picking up a copy of " adam & evil . " it 's not the sort of film a hardcore horror fan wants friends to see prominently displayed on the movie shelf . there are plenty of other worthier slashers out there that demand your attention .

dvd pos 561.txt i 'm the first to confess that i had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 robert wise gothic noir , the house on telegraph hill , but it does n't matter , because all the actors are good , and combined with an extremely effective plot , the movie is a terrific tale of murder , deceit and assumed identities in post world war san francisco . as was the fashion with many noir films of the time , the house on telegraph hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine . she tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale , and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened . however , the narrative soon jumps to germany at the end of the war , and we meet victoria kopwelska ( valentina cortese ) is a polish woman imprisoned in belsen . with her husband and family dead , victoria tells the kindly american commander major marc bennett ( william lundigan ) that there 's nothing for her back in poland . desperate to survive , victoria learns that her best friend has family in the united states , and if they are ever freed , she promises to take victoria to america with her . her friend however , is killed shortly before american troops can liberate the camp . with nowhere to go , victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend 's papers and sail to america , where she learns now the godmother to a young boy chris ( gordon gebert ) , as well as the heir to a sizable fortune , and a gorgeously gothic house high atop telegraph hill , following the death of her " aunt . " ensconced in the ostensible mansion , victoria , now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy 's guardian alan spender ( richard basehart ) , partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security . as victoria becomes a " mother " to the boy , she clashes with his governess margaret ( fay baker ) and coincidently reconnects with marc whom she met a belsen , now a studly a playboy type lawyer . all the adults are not as they seem : marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money , and victoria 's arrival causes him to draft a new scheme . victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good . and then there 's the margaret , the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to chris are all they seem . the film is compelling , and tension-fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white . cortese is especially good in one of her first american roles and as victoria , she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade , yet through no fault of her own , she steadily becomes a victim of alan 's scheming . of particular note are the stunning location shots of san francisco . the main house is just beautiful and the scenes when victoria is playing baseball with chris offer stunning views of san francisco bay . the house on telegraph hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers - there 's a runaway car , poisoned orange juice , an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity . it all makes for a gripping and entertaining film . victoria starts out as a victim , and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on telegraph hill , her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and chris . mike leonard april 06.

music neg 907.txt at no point in my following review am i by any means intentionally downing hank jr. i am just trying to give an honest review of this cd . at the time this album was realeased , hank jr. was riding high , winning big at the cma 's and acm's . he was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career . but then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll . to me this cd is a studio recorded version of a hank williams jr. live concert . the only difference is he did n't botch the vocals as he does on his live show . the music is decidedly 80% not country , it drifts towards eighties rock . if you trace hank jr. 's recording career , you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of . i must say though , this cd contains one of hanks last top 10 hits , " if the south woulda won , " which is an hard to find recording on his compilations . i 'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise , just because of that song .

books neg 59.txt the setting of this book is beautiful , exotic , and interesting . the author , unfortunately , does nothing to take advantage of this . i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award . it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless , or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year - - which i doubt . the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else , as far as i am concerned . i ca n't imagine it being done worse ! tuck 's writing style - - short vignettes or episodes , one after another - - is terribly ineffective and disjointed . i felt completely detached from all of the characters . i did n't feel like i gained any understanding of who they were , and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies . another thing that completely irritated me were tuck 's sexual references . throughout the novel , tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter ( a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest , for example ) . these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader ; all they did was gross me out . they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy , not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story . i do n't know what tuck was trying to do in this novel . i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level : it is not entertaining . it is not profound . it is not educational . it is not beautiful . at only 248 pages , i ca n't say it was even a quick read . utterly forgettable , once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it .

camera neg 260.txt i bought the sd300 to take with me touring by motorcycle . it is so small , i can just put it in a belt case and always have it . with the appropriate sd card i can take a huge number of pictures at a high quality setting . the pictures turn out great , but . eight months after i bought it , the lcd screen suddenly went all crazed when turned on , tho there was no visible damage . i returned it for repair , no problem , no expense , had it back in two weeks . less than 3 months later , same thing . i know i did not drop or bump it , it went down in the 10 minutes between showing some pictures to one person , then to another , indoors . i called , was told it was still under warranty from the previous repair , and got a return label . then i got an e-mail saying that i would have to pay $97 for repairs to the lcd screen caused by impact damage . i replied to the e-mail to protest , and was ignored . i finaly called , and was told that tho the warranty was still in force , this damage was not covered . checking aroun the web , i found that this is a common problem , not damage . unfortunately , i had already authorized the repair when i found this out , so i guess i am stuck . i have several canon products , will not buy any more

books neg 167.txt the book is well-written . most parts of it i can agree with . but there is a crucial mistake in parson 's message - - - oneness likes to play separation . i can say clearly that oneness does not play separation . duality / ego is simply a mistake / illusion caused by mind-evolution . saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion . also , his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the " mercy " of something , and this is clearly very dualistic . without ego , both doing and not doing are actions of oneness , to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake . there are many illuminating sentenses in this book , but be aware of the neo-advaitan trap . in my life , it was understanding , especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come to oneness . the one who is doing the understanding is still oneness . there is no duality in doing and not doing . at right this moment , you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop . of courses , you make choices in daily life . if you really understand what is meant by " nond-duality " , you will not make such statements such as " there is no choice " . 
books neg 850.txt perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses , boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others . lacking even the slightest trace of shame , he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses . as a result , there 's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages . even more pitiably , like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to " sanitize " his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source , boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed . one wearies quickly of the manichaean results . and like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear ( or social ) engineer , he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally , succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was . why , even the title itself has been purloined from alistair home 's 1977 underground classic , " a savage war of peace " ! * considering that home 's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from boot 's , this is irony most profound . it is scarcely surprising , then , that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in boot 's book , thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it - - unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the ozymandian ruins of boot 's espoused belief system . * recently reprinted and highly recommended !

dvd neg 191.txt this film is a perfect example of how straight action and big-name stars cannot replace the necessity of well written drama . i will not give away the plot - - although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it . basically clooney 's character mr. ocean , a career burgler , is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a las vegas casino . so he recruits 11 men , each with a talent to add to the operation . this is where the trouble begins . the viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters . there is almost no introduction to many of them , and barely even a mention of their names . literally half an hour into the film " the eleven " are assembled and they 're already robbing the casino . how 's that for plot development ? and that 's basically it ladies and gentlemen : go to vegas , rob casino , go home , movie over . some of the " good guys " are even outright repellant . our would-be heros ' enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy hollywood tycoon . am i supposed to like this fat weasel ? the only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least mr. ocean , is that the guy he 's robbing , the casion owner , is a really bad guy . supposedly he has people killed ' n stuff . ( this actor played a bad guy in godfather part 3 ) . but we never see any real evil deeds . in fact , he just seems like a handsome , polite , very prosperous businessman . he manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film . mr. ocean on the other hand , and his cohorts , are career criminals . but the guy they 're robbing is an even greater criminal , you see . so that makes it ok . and really , if you were being robbed , would n't you want to be robbed by george clooney and brad pitt ? they 're such nice guys . that makes getting robbed fun . just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy . how thrilling . this entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with julia roberts . there are a few minor things going on in the backgroung , like a boxing match , which are essentially irrelevent . throughout there seems to be vital information missing ( like say , a plot ) . soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to clooney and roberts . this film is also horribly cut . several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced , and then completely forgotten about . take the scene where pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino 's owner makes an appearence . the folder he has just been handed , explains pitt , contains secret security codes . you would think that would be something important right ? you would think they will need to get those codes . well , wrong . in fact you wo n't hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie . they introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development . and that happens all the time in this movie . in fact mr. ocean 's team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties . ( and boy , they started repelling down that shaft quick , did n't they ? you did n't even know they were robbing the place yet . wow , these guys are good . or maybe steven soderbergh is as over-rated as his film . ) they make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7-eleven . this , after mr. ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have . one would hope this film would at least end strong . but soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed . we are left wondering whether the " eleven " actually got away with their caper...or worse . what a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light-hearted . the writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the dvd ! ( as did the actors in their commentary . ) probably the best moment on this dvd is hearing the screenwriter tell soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending . i am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars , since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad , but this film comes very close to 1 star . this is your standard artistically worthless hollywood product . it is big on budget , big on bling , and low on story . i suppose if you just feel like wasting some time , this is as good a way to do it as any . personally i would rather have a story with more substance 
books neg 547.txt from a sociological perspective , hustlers , beats , and others serves what it set out to do , explore the sociological aspects of billiards in america and the culture that has accompained it through time . however with the recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society , many of his observations and conclusions are dated if not false . te book just goes to many places , crime , pornography , etc. and fails what it set out to originally acomplish . furthermore , i find it quite unusal that the author chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards . is this not a sociological perspective , or an historical editorial.as a college student , and a sociology major , the author fails to win my support from his argument . all in all , quite disapointing as i found it at my local bookstore and the cover looked interesting . i was left with a feeling of disappointment when i finished this book , as it completely crushed many of the idealization and ideologies and norms that are associated to theculture of billiards . stick with the sociology , cut the editoria 
camera neg 479.txt normally i wouldnt write a review , but i have had numerous experiences with this camera that i thought i would share . my sister first bought the camera , and i was amazed with how user friendly it was and i thought the pictures turned out pretty well . shortly afterward , her screen blacked out , without any great impact or weather damage . naturally , i assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way , tough luck . i then proceeded to buy one for myself , and a couple of months after i had it , my screen also inexplicably failed to work . and then for christmas , my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one , and yet again , shortly after purchase , the screen was broken . i do accept some responsibility for the damage , i imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag , perhaps it got rattled around a bit . but three times ? i dont find this to be a coincidence , and i do not reccomend that you risk your money , because you too may have to replace it after 3 months 
camera pos 597.txt through most of the 1990s , i lived overseas in both europe and asia . unfortunately , my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as i hated looking like a " tourist " with my bulky camera ! nowadays , i no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one ! i intially bought this t7 after using a friend 's t1 and being impressed with the size of it . the t7 is obviously considerably smaller , which is even better ! i bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $400 for it plus a 1gb memory stick pro . both are investments that even to this day ( over a year later ) i am very happy with . i have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever i go people love to look at it . i can say i 've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes . as far as size , that is the biggest plus to it 's advantage . it can fit anywhere . even with the optional case that you can buy for it , it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket , without even a noticable bulge . as far as photo quality goes , as most of the reviews note , the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots . i 've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you 'll get , but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash , what can you expect ? after shooting a few thousand photos with this camera , i know what will be a good and bad night shot , and with the playback feature , you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed . is it perfect ? no , but that 's super tough in a camera this small . some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still . i 've never had issue with this , but i could see how it could be an issue , it 's just never one either my wife ( the primary user ) or i have dealt with . i would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem . i 've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger ( and more expensive ) point-and-shoot digital cameras . i have been very pleased with that . another drawback noted by many reviews is the lcd screen and the chance of breaking it . i put a plastic screen protector ( the thin plastic sheet type held by static ) on it as soon as i bought it and have n't had a problem . i 've sat on the camera before ( by accident , of course ! ) and have had it in luggage and the like , but have never had a problem . the most significant drawback that i 've had with the camera is that it can take more photos ( esp with the 1gb card ) than the battery will last . buy a second battery and you 'll be more than good , but it 's just something to keep in mind . i would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels , or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos . it can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots , it 's all that you need . i can say that we have many photos of our kids ( and really good ones , too ) that we would never had gotten if my wife did n't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag ! i 'm happy enough with it that i 'm going to buy a second one for myself ( especially now that the prices have dropped so much ! ) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography . i give it five stars and would definately recommend it to others

music pos 162.txt i have to admit that , at first listening , i found some aspects of ms.belle 's interpretations of these pieces disorienting . however , as i listened to these covers repeatedly , i can now say that i understand better what the vocalist is after . not that i always agree with her and with george duke , the arranger / producer , but i agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened . ms.belle has immense talent , superb technique , and a clear idea of each piece , and she delivers the goods without faltering or compromise . i admire that a lot in a performer . her choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject what she has offered us . when i first heard these renditions , i was quite stand-offish , but over time i have come to appreciate them more and more - almost to the point of addiction - and am grateful to regina and george for their strength of conviction as well as their superior musicianship.they do not want us to listen in a passive way , they are waiting for our reaction..and god , this is really so , so good....that 's the true spirit in which an album should be recorded . i 'd encourage you to get this album because it is about strong , powerful and personal interpretations of some great jazz standards by regina . you may love everything about it , or you may reject aspects of her interpretations . but in any case you will not remain indifferent ; you will be enriched by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way . that is an important aspect of why i love this imaginative , innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable . and it cannot be said enough that her backing band is incredible , giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge . it is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized . regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould and make a successful cross-over , which some purists may not approve of.. . only time will tell... .

dvd neg 948.txt with the straight story , lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love . this film felt like a " blind date " gone bad . the straight story showed up , david lynch arrived , but the rest of the date felt muddled , confusing , and utterly disastrous . everything in this film seemed wrong . lynch 's choice for lead actor , the bland sissy spacek , the filler of repeat cornfield montages , all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read , i just felt that nobody had control over this picture , yet the randomness ( and the possible tear ending ) gave critics something to smile about . this is not a david lynch film , and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive , twin peaks , or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated . the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa , but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois , it just seemed repetitive and boring . what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose . alvin lying on the ground because he ca n't get up , the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating , while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame . spacek 's depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale . she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes . i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema , but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors . then , to add more fuel to the fire , there was richard farnsworth . again , he is n't a horrible actor , but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically , but alas , could n't master it mentally . farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen . i could n't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character . his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes , and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending . his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic , while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime , i saw it as babble ( and no , i am not that insensitive - i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger , more professional actor ) . the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant . i wanted lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all , but alas , it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap . speaking of david lynch , where did he go in this film ? there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love , but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns ' " looking at america " class . i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film . instead of keeping us by alvin 's side throughout his journey , lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn . there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while , but when the same images were used over and over again , i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about . i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film . he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin , but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for . i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way . alvin was a walking storybook , filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well . lynch made alvin very closed minded , which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature . alvin was a strong character , but i needed more with this story . i wanted him to make choices , learn new things , and bring that to his brother 's table when they eventually met . i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin , and not vice-versa . overall , i was n't stunned by this picture . i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just " played it safe " . the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin . speaking of alvin , why could n't he have been a stronger , better-rounded character ? i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america , but instead gave us nothing more than soft music , recycled images , and stock characters . the stories were interesting to listen to , but brought nothing fresh to the table . i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye ( since i have a brother as well ) , but why could n't we focus on this further . lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan , when it was the central focus of this film . the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch , but instead it felt jagged and old . i could suggest one viewing for this film , any further , and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be ! grade : ** out of ****

health neg 324.txt i was overwhelmed by the choices , and selected this model , in part , because of the reasonal price . i had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product , but i decided there was only a small possibility of that happening . the instructions said to use the lowest setting initially , which certainly made sense . however , the instructions said to move the adjustment " toward the tip " , which turned out to be the highest , not the lowest setting ! the diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the larger opening , but i read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later . the spray was very powerful and actually " hurt " , especially when it was by my tooth with a crown . the next day i tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink , not in my mouth ! it felt wonderful on the lower setting ! i reread the directions again ( and again over the next several days ) to see if the error was mine or theirs . i still think the directions were not written properly . the third day i had trouble getting any spray at all . this continued for about a week , some days getting more or less , but never a full spray on any setting ! my guess is that it was in a permanent " pause " mode . i gave up and pursued returning the item . it needed to be returned to an " authorized repair " , which luckily was only a few miles away ( there were only three in my state ) . the repair man had told me , over the phone , it was a discontinued model and had n't been made in about a year . when he looked at it , he found it had been made in 2006. he said he could fix it , but was n't allowed to ; i am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail .

camera pos 466.txt i bought my k10d in dec 06 after owning a number of pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering . the combination of features , if executed properly , make this camera the best buy in 10mp dslrs right now . i postponed my review because i wanted to get some real field experience . i just went to mexico , and panicked because i left the camera instruction manual behind . i can now report on that trip . i did a little fumbling at first , mainly because i did n't have the manual , but i was soon able to find the combinations i wanted , and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively . the af button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed . i found myself in difficult lighting situations often , and both af and exposure metering worked quite well . i also took some hand-held shots that i normally would use a tripod with ( such as at 450mm ) , and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement . in a few cases , i used bracketing , and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots . exposure metering worked so well that i stopped bracketing . i particularly liked the display modes : i could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight , and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was " soft " or not right at the scene . the rechargeable li ion batteries , although not readily available in stores , seem to last forever ( even using power zoom , and full-bright display , and some fill flash ) . i believe that i could have shot all week ( 700 shots in raw ( dng ) + jpeg ) with the battery grip attached . in summary , this camera was a pleasure to hold , very easy to use and manipulate , and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos ( even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer ) . i bought it because of its compatibility with pentax lenses , 10mp sensor , shake-reduction technology , larger display , and especially the dust and water seals . but what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results . i am still discovering its features , but i already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past . some of the features on this camera are unique ( new program lines ) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more , making the k10d a good choice and a best buy . once again for pentax , the engineering is supurb . 
dvd pos 27.txt my son was over 2 before we introduced be videos . there are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images , but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot , as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons . unlike some of the other be 's with random visuals , here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired . concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust be video in bonus features . it has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons . and no i did n't care for the commercial either.. . 
books pos 881.txt black metropolis is perhaps the founding document of african-american studies , a classic work of sociology that still resonates today . it is a paradigmatic expression of the chicago school of sociology , however , a school that today stands in some disrepute , at least in some circles . indirectly , it was the target of james baldwin 's famous attack on richard wright in his essay , everybody 's protest novel . the claim of the criticism has been that the chicago school , due to its insistance upon using a & quot ; scientific approach&quot ; , merely reproduces the very terms under which african-americans have been oppressed- -a claim that has proceeded under the warrant of european intellectuals such as theodor adorno . still , black metropolis is a landmark study , and , unfortunately , many if not most of its observations and conclusions remain true today , and in fact it could be argued that conditions in the black belt of chicago have gotten worse , not better , since 1945 , the year of black metropolis ' publication- -which lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above , though perhaps it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of the chicago school as they are criticisms of american society . since then , as we know , we have witnessed a great shift in american public opinion away from what some consider to be the excesses of those days ; so much so , in fact , that the work of black metropolis may again be regarded as a profoundly useful book . embodying american liberalism as it does- -which counted as a grave sin thirty years ago- -black metropolis may possibly be due for a fresh look

software neg 297.txt i use turbotax every year and i would e-file also . it says i can e-file for $16.95 and it even says that 's all it will cost on one of the last windows . then right before it is about to transmit it says $16.95 for federal plus $16.95 for state plus 2.5 percent what i owe to some " third party " company , thats $25 for each 1 , 000 you owe . if i 'm paying some third company to transmit my return than why am i paying turbotax to do it also ? so ok i 'll print it out and send it in . it wants to print out every worksheet and statement for a total of 53 pages . it no longer gives you the option to just print the pages you need . i am now cornered into paying the extra $90 to efile or go through the torture of printing out 53 pages in which i need only 5 or 6. dirty trick . it makes the total cost $130. it would of been cheaper and more efficent going to a good accountant . other than that the program has worked even easier than ever before 
books pos 307.txt always lively and perspicacious , this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle : while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations ( weapons , diseases , horses , etc. ) for why europeans spread so thickly into north america , australia , new zealand and argentina ( the lands crosby labels " neo-europes " ) , what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well ? the question does n't appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion , but the european housefly , and feral pigs , and a horde of other weeds , pests , crops , diseases and livestock from europe followed suit . quite often these organisms , even the domesticated ones , raced ahead of european explorers themselves , rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom . why was this so ? why did n't , say , australian weeds , their seeds inadvertently shipped back to england , eventually carpet the meadows and fields of europe ? to answer this odd question , professor crosby begins his story with pangaea- -the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe . these " seams of pangaea " then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet , and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when european mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams . crosby details case after case in each category : weeds , pests , livestock , diseases and crops . he forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear . what is the answer ? he drops clues every now and then , and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters : if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans , then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all . here , then is the answer : all the opportunistic fellow-travelers of the european diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the old world civilizations- -and they , in turn , furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium . together- -humans , horses , cattle , pigs , rats , clover , peaches , measles and , yes , dandelions- -comprised a potent self-replicating system , dimly discerned by its contemporaries , that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of pangaea

dvd neg 503.txt even though i am not a streisand fan , i was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was . the plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for streisand 's character , making her attractive - no , irresistible - to the main male character . the problem is , she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover ! somebody ( probably streisand ) thinks that highlighted hair , a tight black cocktail dress , and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress , casual clothes , and everyday looks are disgusting . baaaaaamp ! ( that 's the fallacy alarm going off : men , in my experience , do n't care much about clothes and makeup . ) there was a lot of emphasis placed on the streisand character 's losing weight by riding an exercise bike , but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference ! yet truly , the low point of the movie is the scene in which streisand , discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother ( played by lauren bacall ) , blubbers , " wazz i a pretty baby ? wazz i a pretty babyyyyeeee ? " in that one scene , streisand 's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed . the whole movie is about this issue , and it 's amazing that an entire cast , crew , and production company would devote themselves to b.s. 's emotional issues like that . i really think that the " funny girl " phenomenon somehow ruined streisand 's thought processes . the media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped , northern european beauty standard of the time ( think grace kelly ; think ingrid bergman.... . ) . i recall reading about how her glowing complexion , thick hair , and good figure ( as well as her energy and voice ) carried her through despite her looks : long nose , large lips , slanted eyes . myself , i think she looks like an egyptian princess or similar ; but she certainly does n't look like grace kelly.... . so why ca n't she accept this ? the majority of us women , whatever our race , color , or bone-structure , learn to live with and love who we are.....at least i hope we do ! this movie is not about that . this movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable . maybe i should 've given it only one star 
music pos 380.txt i would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years into eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here ! ! i think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is tim roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful ( ive learned some of their songs this way ) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days . and the rest of this band has so much talent , stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting . plus jims drum work , how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers , he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well . this album plain rocks , it should be known as these guys were on gigantour and rocked there too . be cool if them and annihilator went on tour . i have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same ! 
software pos 813.txt this is a good computer bible , but for the money , i prefer a program like amg bible essentials which has the libronix library system built-in and can be integrated with other bible study software . for about $15 more the amg program has both kjv , apocrypha and nasb , including a lot of other capability , like greek translations , word study , exegesis , parallel bible comparisons , etc. the rainbow bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above . some benefits of this bible include both niv and kjv translations , color maps , matthew henry 's commentary , naves and a version of foxe 's book of martyrs . the various colors can be distracting at times , but overall it is worth considering , particularly if you like the niv

books neg 42.txt though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology , it 's the dryest , most aesthetically difficult to read textbook.. . especially if you happen to be studying the material online / through independent study . the publisher needs to redesign the book and / or you need to have a better online course professor . it feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material ( which is interesting in itself ) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction .

health pos 214.txt i purchased this hairdryer after my professional conair yellowbird from the late 70 's broke . i definitely wanted another conair and i wanted to move into the 21st century ! i did the research and this hairdryer had the most features for the best price . i was n't disappointed . as the other reviewers have stated , this hairdryer dries your hair in half the time ! it 's also nice to reduce the static in your hair when you want to freshen up and are " dry brushing " your hair . it does draw a lot of power when on high heat and the highest blowing setting and the lights in my dressing room will dim . otherwise , it is very solidly built and i hope to have this hairdryer for another 30 years . 
books neg 842.txt the first novel of laurell k . hamilton 's merry gentry series is not , actually , that terrible a book . it 's by far the best in a not particularly great series , actually . what made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise , the set-up , is one of the most grotesquely , ridiculously stupid things i 've ever read . princess meredith nicessus has fled faerie , in fear of death at the hands of her aunt , andais , the queen of air and darkness and ruler of the unseelie court . high profile fae in this world are major public figures , like rock stars or the royal family of england . the sudden disappearance of one of the unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed . every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away . we are told solemnly that reports of princess meredith being spotted are right up there with elvis sightings . meredith 's image , the story of her mysterious disappearance , is everywhere . i mean , neolithic pygmies living in deepest africa know who meredith is , and what she looks like . meanwhile , princess meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye . thing is , she has n't disguised herself very much at all . her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin . her fae red hair is now human red hair . her facial features remain the same . and with everyone on the planet wondering where is princess meredith , for years on end , no one recognizes her . let me hasten to add , there is no magic involved in this , they honestly simply do n't recognize her . and the crowning touch to this masterful disguise , the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she 's actually princess meredith is....wait for it....merry gentry . jesus wept . and for years , none of her co-workers , no one who knows her , says to themself , " hey , wait a minute , that women who looks almost exactly like princess meredith....merry gentry....princess meredith....oh my god , merry gentry is princess meredith ! " nope , she 's just incognito , baby . at which point i almost threw down the book and said , " you have got to be kidding me . " it 's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process . do laurell hamilton 's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing ? given her past six or eight novels , including this one , i 'm tempted to say : no , actually 
music neg 980.txt i love plenty of contemporary country music.. . everything from " new bluegrass " ( alison krauss & union station ) to " new country " like reba mcentire , rascal flatts , brad paisley , martina.. . even a lot of faith & shania . but i think this cd is crap . the single star is for the only good song on the album , " heads carolina , tails california " - - but really , 1 star for one good song out of ten is a bit too generous . i 'm astounded at how bad the other 9 songs are.. . elementary-school rhyming , uninspired melody lines , stupid lyrics , below-average accompaniment , etc. one of the most annoying things to me is her habit of overpronnouncing every word in a song.. . i 'd guess someone told her at some point that she slurs her words , and she was trying to overcompensate . the result should be titled " hooked on phonics , starring jodee messina . " listen to the preview of " on a wing and a prayer " for a good example of what i 'm talking about . i thank my lucky stars i borrowed this cotton candy from the library , rather than shelling out $16 for one song . do yourself a favor and buy " heads carolina , tails california " online if you must have it

dvd neg 411.txt a style over substance celebration of the drag queen mentality - if you enjoy misogynist bitchy dialogue being delivered by pantomime women , this movie is for you elliot 's love of drag queens overshadows the rest of this flimsy , contrived and lame narrative - clealry it 's about getting as many shots as possble of drag queen costumes against the outback setting it 's alleged stance against homophobia and plea of acceptance of difference is trite and cringeworthy if anything , this film reinforces negative stereotypes of gay men as nasty effeminate queens who are not to be taken serioulsy . sadly it 's been embraced by the same pandering gay men who think drag queens are ' camp ' and therefore funny , indicative of how off the mark they are of what defines camp ( go read susan sontag boys ) and how low ' gay culture ' as plummeted . there are plentiful nasty jokes targeting female gentilia , and a secondary racist commentary about thai women ' entrapping ' aussie men trashy and not in a good way . a must have for no brainer gay men .

music pos 382.txt back when blondie was being hailed as the biggest new-wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike , there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed blondie as " bubblegum pop , " and one group that would never have staying power . but i think it 's been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh . parallel lines helped establish blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success . this album is also the first where debbie harry 's voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet , vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next . the album made punk , pop , and disco shake hands , which was a method unheard of in 1978. songs like " hanging on the telephone , " " picture this , " " pretty baby , " and " sunday girl , " have become irresitable pop gems , while " i know but i do n't know , " and " fade away & radiate , " featuring a terrific guitar lick by robert fripp , are punk-driven classics . last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in " one way or another , " and " heart of glass . " and how has debbie harry played out as lead singer after all these years ? as rolling stone stated when this album was ranked #140 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time , " madonna was surely watching .

camera neg 280.txt the look and feel of this camcorder is very good . unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities . for example , evening party , indoor school activities , kid drama and orchestra . this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities . earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 , which was way better than this camcorder . this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price . one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom . most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors . these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light . if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light , i do not recommend it .

camera pos 303.txt first thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying . the kit lens comes with canon 20d , 30d , 300d , or xt is the lower version , non usm one . on the higher version usm ones , you will see the red color " usm " at the front of the lens . according to the reviews , compare with the non usm ones , optically they are the same . however , the usm motor does focus faster and much quieter . people complain about the build quality . actually i feel that it is really not that bad , much better than the canon 50mm f1.8 ii . the usm auto focus performance is fast , never hunt , and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 ii . it fits nicely on the xt . do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more . we have to compare apple to apple . if you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely , the images will come out nicely . 1. this is not the lens for indoors low light conditions . if you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed , go get a different lens . ( for example , i use a canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation . ) 2. the distortion on 18mm is quite a bit . avoid taking strait lines ( like buildings ) pictures on the edge while wide open . however , this can be easily corrected on computers . 3. step down the aperture to f8 or f11 , the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners . overall , the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens . it is very light weight and highly portable while traveling . this fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens .

books neg 747.txt when i first picked up drinking coffee elsewhere , i was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy . and , truthfully , it 's not a horrible book . it is entertaining , the style works , etc. on that note , if you 're looking for a fun read and do n't plan on thinking about it too much , then by all means , get it . my problem with the book is that it does n't deserve all the acclaim it 's getting- - if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of america , this is not your book . probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it 's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the african american female . packer has very little new to say , and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by alice walker and other writers , but have also have been said better by those authors . drinking coffee elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of you ca n't keep a good woman down , a book that , while having its own problems , would probably be a better use of your time and money if you 're really interested in the social commentary in the text . even from the literary standpoint , it 's not terribly outstanding . the characters are stereotypes ; the plots are predictable . the adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person- - an intelligent outsider who struggles with race , religion , and fitting in- - and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so . the other protagonists are the same , just not so irritable . similar to this lack of variation in her characters , packer varies little in her narrative style . yes , the language is pretty at times , but there is no experimentation with language or structure ; all of the writing is in a highly generic voice . finally , the stories themselves contain scenes that are n't necessary and that detract from the actual narrative . in short , drinking coffee elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books is n't actual talent , but how much your publisher backs you . packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs , which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out

software pos 929.txt rosetta stone spanish is the third major spanish course that i am buying . i have comtpleted all of the spanish lessons in the pimsleur series , and have also completed learning spanish like crazy level one and two . i am one of those rare latinas that did not learn spanish from my parents . my mexican parents felt that it would be easier to " assimilate " if i only spoke english . after going to my grandparents ' home for holidays and being the only one there that did not speak spanish , and after having latino strangers speak to me in spanish and then look at me in astonishment when i struggled just to say " no , hablo espanol , " i felt that it was time for me to learn how to speak my language . the first course that i used was pimsleur spanish . compared to rosetta stone i must say that i learned much more vocabulary with the rosetta stone software . but i recommend pimsleur over rosetta stone , especially for the complete beginner . because of its easy teaching method , in my opinion pimsleur is even better than lslc for someone that has no experience whatsoever speaking spanish . pimsluer goes at a very slow pace . but if you have already learned some spanish on your own or in high school or college , then you can probably skip pismleur and go straight to lslc . or if you are the type of person that believes learning a foreign language should be more like a hurdle than a marathon you 'll probably want to go with learning spanish like crazy . lslc covers a lot more spanish words and grammar than pimsleur and moves at a quicker pace . so where does rosetta stone fit in ? i would say use rosetta stone after you have completed the above courses . it is difficult to really learn how to speak spanish with this software alone because you are only looking at pictures and repeating the phrases that you hear . you never really learn how to think in spanish and create your own sentences . so why am i still giving it 4 stars ? because if you already know how to speak some spanish from another course and you are on an intermediate level then you can add plenty more spanish words to your vocabulary by using the rosetta stone software . one negative about this course is that the method is tedious because the software 's interface is " antiquated " with photos from the 1980s . and the sound quality is not as clear as pimsleur or learning spanish like crazy . but if you stick it out through the drudgery , you will be surprised with how many spanish words you learned with this software . but i think pimsleur did a better job of teaching me concepts than this software is doing . and by teaching me concepts , i have really retained the material and by understanding concepts , i am able to take my own thoughts and form sentences . something that i would not have been able to do if i had used this course alone . another negative about this course , is that unlike the other two courses that i mentioned , you have to use rosetta stone while sitting in a computer . that is difficult for me because i am very busy with classes , work and my personal life . i can use pimsleur or lslc on my mp3 player and not have to worry about sitting at a computer . besides the limited vocabulary and the slow teaching method , the only downside of pimsleur is that it does not teach the same spanish words that are most commonly used by mexicans and other latinos in regular conversation . pimsleur spanish is very formal spanish . we say " mucho gusto " like lslc teaches , pimsleur teaches " encantado . " and in our overly " macho " culture if a man responds with " encantado " many latinos may get the wrong impression about him . it is not something that i am proud to say about my ( latino ) culture , but it is true . and pimsleur does not warn the male student that if you say " encantado " to some latinos they may get the wrong impression about the speaker . learning spanish like crazy has taught me useful practical spanish that i can use to communicate with my spanish speaking friends and family . when i tell people that i learned to speak spanish as an adult and not at home as a child , many of them do not believe me . i think they find it incredible for two reasons : one , my accent really sounds like a native speaker from using lslc . two , i have learned real conversational spanish from lslc . i have learned words and phrases that spanish speakers actually use when speaking to each other . pimsleur taught me spanish that the author of the course thought that i should speak , not the spanish that latinos really speak . that is one of the positive things that separates lslc course from the others . so in what order would i rate the three in terms of ease of teaching method : 1. pimsleur spanish 2. learning spanish like crazy 3. rosetta stone spanish but in terms of teaching real conversational spanish and teaching a real latin american accent , i rate them as follows : 1. learning spanish like crazy 2. pimsleur spanish 3. rosetta stone spanish

camera neg 908.txt i bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work . i did n't really have high expectations for it , because it was so inexpensive . as soon as it was turned on i had the following problems : 1 ) five seconds after i turn it on , it always says " usb connected ! " - - and i do n't have a usb cable inserted into it ! this also freezes the device . i found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted . 2 ) i cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual . my computer does recognize the usb device , but when i try to copy files over to the frame , i get a " path is not found " error . 3 ) i thought i could live with the above 2 problems if it could just show my pictures . so i used a card reader to load .jpg files onto a cf card at 400x300 resolution . when , i plugged the card into the frame , these files show up as " invalid " when i try to view them . emailed coby with the 3 bullet points above , got a response 30 hours later saying : " coby tech support to me 5:25 am ( 3 hours ago ) hello , we have received your inquiry . it appears that your unit is defective . return the unit to the retailer for an exchange . " what an inconvenience and disappointment . i will be buying a different product 
dvd neg 465.txt i saw this movie and i found it both shocking and choking . it displays children as young as 4 years old smoking cigarettes ! did the filmmakers take into account the damage tobacco could have done to these child stars ? ( yes , the cigarettes and the smoke were real , not cg . ) i think they should have omitted such scenes from the script , because it displays a behavior that 's not only illegal in several countries , but also threatening to both society and childhood . no matter what the other reviewers thought about the movie , i give it a disgusting 1 , and this is the last movie i ever watch that depicts smoking children . to those that have n't yet watched this movie , please do n't watch it , unless you want cancer to win the health wars . and here i hand out a lesson for every active or aspiring moviemaker : if you want to depict smoking children , use computer graphics instead of the real thing

software neg 29.txt i have to qualify this review by saying that i do not own pm 8.0 , so i cannot fairly give a rating , despite overwhelmingly negative reviews . i can only relate personal experience with norton / symantec products . i do own and have used pm 6.0 since ' 01 when it was still powerquest instead of norton / symantec and it has worked very well , though the gui is a bit quirky . i have run it with 2 drives , one with 98se and xp pro , with pm loaded on 98se partition and it did everything i needed on both drives . trouble is , version 5.0 is , afaik , not compatible with xp and since m$ no longer supports 98se , we have a problem , houston . currently i am using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed . if i get a drive partitioning software product compatible with xp , it most assuredly will not be anything produced by norton / symantec , based on these reviews and personal experience with norton / symantec products . i first bought a computer in ' 98 and used norton antivirus 5.0. at that time , norton was probably the best antivirus product out there . it worked flawlessly and i used and recommended it for years . no more . i purchased a copy of symantec system works 2005 right after it was released . long story short , i no longer use norton products because i got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become , and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores . there is one lone symantec product i still use- --windoctor , which is not installed on my ' puter but ran from the cd as needed . adios , anything else produced by norton / symantec . it ai n't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin .

dvd pos 277.txt i guess i understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it 's year of release , 1986. prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of " purple rain , " both the film and the soundtrack . and critics love to knock someone off a pedestal , which is what they did to prince in those days . many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip . they could n't believe prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself . it was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that is n't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy . of course , poor critical response alone does n't usually keep the public from making a movie popular . yet " under the cherry moon " was a bomb at he box office . probably the main reason for this is that the movie , although shot in color , was released in black-and-white . for some unfathomable reason , the general movie-going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white movie . now do n't get me wrong , i 'm not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves . i 'm only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color . i will acknowledge that this movie 's target audience is prince fans . since i am one myself , and have been most of my life , i 'm not the most entirely objective viewer . but i make no apologies for my love of this movie . it 's not a " guilty pleasure " for me , because i proudly hold this as one of my favorites . i had only seen it a couple times before the dvd release - and unfotunately i missed it in theaters ( i could n't get anyone to take me , i was only 12 and none of my friends were into p and certainly not my parents - though my dad went with me a few years later to see " grafitti bridge " on opening night , but that 's for another review ) . but since it 's dvd release in 2004 , this has become one of my most-watched discs in my collection . the soundtrack is killer , the tunes make up one of the best prince albums ever . there 's even some great stuff heard in the movie that did n't make the album ( some of which was issued on 12 " vinyl ) . plus , i think the movie looks great - the cinematographer was michael ballhaus , who has multiple academy award nominations to his credit ( and was the dp on numerous martin scorsese classics ) . i wonder how the movie would feel in color , but i do think black-and-white was the right way to go . even though the movie is set in then-contemporary times , it has the feel of something from the ' 30s . there are so many classic moments in this movie , i wo n't try to list them all . but here are a few.. . christopher tracy ( prince ) giving his " bela lugosi eyes " ...tricky ( jerome benton ) tossing rose petals into the tub while christopher takes a bath...christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery...the " wreka stow " scene...the car race between christopher and mary sharon ( kristen scott thomas ) . as for the acting , i 've heard a lot of people saying that prince 's performance was no good . i do n't see much truth in that claim . after being so serious in " purple rain , " it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this . jerome benton proved he could do just fine even without morris day at his side ( as in " purple rain " ) - i 'm surprised jerome has n't done much additional acting outside of prince movies . and obviously kristen scott thomas moved on from this , her first major role , to become an oscar-nominated , highly repected leading lady . how is the dvd presentation ? pretty good , for such a largely overlooked movie . the widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix are n't anything phenomenal , but get the job done nonetheless ; the movie looks and sounds fine . as for features , anyone expecting a full-blown special edition like the 2-disc " purple rain " will be disappointed . but at least it 's not a completely bare-bones release - four music videos are included , though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio / visual quality ( though they are passable , i would 've preferred 5.1 mixes ) . the highlight is the live performance of " anotherlover " which was taken from a never-released ( at least not domestically , not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the u.s. ) concert video documenting the parade tour . mtv held an interesting ( i.e. - very weird ) contest to determine where " under the cherry moon " would have it 's world premiere . the ten-thousandth caller to an mtv hotline would accompany prince to the premiere , which would be held in their hometown . mtv ran a special that covered the premiere party - and unlike the premiere of " purple rain " unfortunately this program is not to be found on " under the cherry moon " ' s dvd release . lisa barber was the contest winner , and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of sheridan , wyoming - a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere . when asked what he thought of the town of sheridan , prince summed it up with a single word : " purple . "

music pos 993.txt this film came out in 1973 and i saw it in its original full length version ( about 3hours and 15 min . ) executives from columbia pictures were there , it was the premeire , and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out ( verbal ) and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums . the executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across columbus circle in boston and i and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free . we returned to the film and i have always loved this crazy redition of lost horizon , the miscasting , the terrible sets , the odd ball music for the story , the dubbed liv ullmann , the dance routines of olivia hussey..all of it . you cannot find a musical like it , or a soundtrack like it . columbia execs were unimaginative ; they should have believed in this film . the next day after this premeire in boston , new york etc. ( simultaneous i suppose ) the film was cut , the posters were taken down..there was a ton of material to buy..t shirts , dolls , posters of all sizes , bath towels with the poster on them , records of the sd tk of course , and small pop up sets of the entire film . it was to be a massive hit..in two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed , and the posters said , last two weeks , and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared . but many people came to see it..lines of people , and , when they heard it had been cut , they gave up , and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film . i have many treasures from that opening nite , and now i have the cd of the sound track . anyone who loves movie magic or madness has to see and hear this film ; it is unique . enjoy this soundtrack and get your hands on a dvd ..they are out there

software neg 570.txt having had norton products installed for years including antivirus , internet security , and systemworks , i decided to replace the installed products with norton 360 and a non-norton password manager . obviously , it is critical to first remove all norton programs before installing norton 360. the installation process proceeded relatively smoothly . my computing environment includes a 1.6ghz processor , 1 , 000mb of memory , and 6gb of available disk . the background scans and liveupdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire cpu at 100% cpu utilization . one application that streams radio broadcasts now stops . i immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups , however , the cpu occasionally still locks . additionally , there is no way to transfer security settings from previous norton products to norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive . if you now have separate norton security products and are satisfied with them , save your money and renew the norton subscriptions .

music pos 921.txt nightrage - descent into chaos - thomas lindberg 's latest offering to the music community is the swedish and greek mix called nightrage . this album actually being my first offering to the band i was unsure what to expect . like most i am a big fan of atg and lindberg 's harsh vocal styles... . nightrage however came as a pleasant surprise . ( as in it was n't , yet another , atg clone ) they seem to have more melody than thrash but definitely embody aspects of both genres... . the haunted , where the former atg guitar players are now located , seemed have gone with more thrash then melody . ( which is odd since they actually have atg 's guitar players ? ) anyway , enough comparisons ! nightrage is really decent for a newer band in an over saturated scene.. . amazing guitar work and one of the genres best vocalist makes this cd well worth a couple of listens . also i 've only given this album 2 spins at the current time and stuff like this usually grows on repeated listens . favorite songs : being nothing , phantasma , omen , and descent into chaos . -4 stars if you liked , agreed , or appreciated this please click yes for : " was this review helpful ?

dvd neg 102.txt while some critics can argue with dan brown 's research and reasoning on certain historical points , one thing these da vinci " debunking " presentations will never be able to refute is this : the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and christianity , primarily by the catholic church , and the fact that the church still considered mary magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago : 1969. nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that dan brown has brought out in the open for serious review . this institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the light , when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals . dan brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago , with help from peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still , quite frankly , shocking and debasing . sorry , but upon this " rock " of male dominancy was built the church . thank you again , dan brown , by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations , obscurations and lies . these obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty , insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses , and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources , worth trillions , through guilt , control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power . and those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty dan browns put together . people are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been jesus ' actual relationship with the women in his life- -or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive men 's club with jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship ? to answer these questions , some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth , because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page , especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption . the next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the vatican thrown open for public view . lord only knows what plunder they contain

software pos 805.txt for years i used powerquest 's drive image 7 for backups . it 's rock solid and totally dependable . when symantec aquired powerquest they rolled the underlying technology of drive image 7 into norton ghost . the result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups . most importantly , like drive image 7 , it provides for emergency recovery of your system . just boot from the ghost cd and restore the backup ( restore point ) that you select . i 've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups , and then restoring the system from those backups . the process works flawlessly . if you need to restore to a different physical drive ( replaced a failed drive , etc ) , the process requires a few extra selections , but is still very straightforward . just take the time to read the manual . i 've seen acronis true image recommended by some both here and elsewhere . i 've tried acronis and find it lacking in one major respect : it simply is not reliable . during trials , i made backups with acronis . acronis indicated that the backups were successful but , when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later , acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used . the backups were worthless . when purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles do n't count for anything . the only thing that counts is reliability . it must be able to reliably restore your system . norton ghost passes that test with flying colors .

dvd pos 329.txt terms of endearment captivates me with the believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly portrayed by shirley maclaine and debra winger . it covers approximately 30 years of the turbulent yet loving relationship between mom aurora and daughter emma . they have their differences ; yet the love between them is always so obvious . it 's also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other , even their sex lives . i 've seen this movie several times , and everytime i cry at the end . in spite of the death , the movie ends on a positive note , giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay . the budding relationship between aurora and her neighbor ( also brilliantly portrayed by jack nicholson ) creates a plot-within-a-plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between emma and her husband and children . the most interesting aspect is that emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her , when she has been cheating on him as well . somehow though we sympathize with emma and her gentle lover ( played by the very talented john lithgow ) . we feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship does n't seem wrong . if you are in the mood for a movie that is entertaining and gut-wrenching at the same time , this is a perfect choice

books neg 43.txt i bought this audio cd set at the borders store , without the opportunity to preview the narration . had i been able to do so , i probably never would have purchased it , let alone paid full bookstore price for it . but i needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day , so i relented . lesson learned . the audio quality is very insonsistent , at at times very poor , having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording . while the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the middle east , it does read very much like a history text . with the amount of detail presented , and the wide scope of coverage from one end of europe reaching into the former soviet states and beyond , one immediately feels the need for visual aids ( maps , timelines , etc. ) as guidance . the reader 's narration is monotononous , with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses . each sentence sounds the same as the last . this has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other , and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity . after a while , the narration becomes little more than background noise . no information is retained by the listener

books neg 712.txt i actually know where trieste was before i read this book . unfortunately i have never visited the city . i wanted to read this travel book about this famous city , but after a few chapters , i wondered where the book was going to . after the final chapter , i still do not know what the author 's intentions was with this book . perhaps i do n't read too many travel books . obviously the city means a lot to the author , but she did not express it clearly in her writing . i was scratching my head at the end , and wondering what i read . i learned a little about the city , but not in relation to the amount of time i spent reading this short book . the city of james joyce and maximillian . the imperial port of the austo-hungarian empire . the meeting point of slav , german , and latin empires . one of the ending points of the iron curtain . this city breeds interest and yet the author took us on a round about journal that confuses the reader . i am sure the author 's other books are good , her last one was not the greatest .

health pos 927.txt back in the early 90s i was going through a bad acne period . i finally visited a dermatologist , and he put me on an accutane regimen . i had sensitive skin and a tough beard , so regular shaving cream was too harsh ( especially while taking accutane - the solid brush-on cream i was using at the time burned the edges of my lips ) . he recommended that i shave with cetaphil . years later , my skin and beard are still troublesome . therefore , i 've kept cetaphil as a part of my shaving regimen . cetaphil goes on well and provides a nice lubrication for my shaver . it 's not harsh or irritating , even on a freshly shaved face . however , it 's kind of cold in the morning , which is a bit counter-productive after heating my face with hot water and shower steam to soften the whiskers . so i put the bottle on the tub floor while showering to heat it up with the runoff . by the time i 'm done , it 's warm enough for application after rubbing some around my hands for a second or two . however , even though cetaphil feels good and lubricates well , its consistency is a bit thin to use alone . i like a good lather , so i combine cetaphil with kiss my face moisture shave , which was recommended to me by a woman working at gnc . they mix well together , and i get a good , non-irritating shave by using the gillette fusion power razor . for post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts , i apply a product that contains salicylic acid , such as clean&clear dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . if you have a razor-challenging beard and skin combination like me , then make cetaphil part of your shaving routine . recommended 
music neg 253.txt i first became a fan of the gorillaz with their excellent 2nd cd , demon days . the interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so " out there " that when you first hear one of their cd's ...it sounds like complete garbage . but once you listen again and again , you start to like it more and more . eventually you end up really liking the cd . that was the case with demon days . after enjoying that cd fully , i thought i should check out the first gorillaz cd , and i did n't like it all that much . there just seems to be very little actual songs on the cd . way too much of it sounds like complete filler . there were a couple throwaway songs on demon days , but most of the stuff on that cd was great . here , we 've got songs that are just...boring . nothing happens . i was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs , but it never happens . you just listen to 2-d whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background . ( such as on songs like new genious , man research , and starshine . ) some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all , sometimes sounding just like static noise . songs like this , such as double bass , are cool for a minute or two , but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes . it gets boring . other songs , like 5 / 4 , m1 a1 , and rock the house are catchy at first , but just do n't have staying power . they get old . 5 / 4 got annoying quickly , m1 a1 and punk lost their appeal quickly , and rock the house is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it . and songs like latin simone are just annoying . the remixes of 19-2000 and clint eastwood that end the cd are also fairly forgettable , although 19-2000 's kind of catchy on the first couple listens . there are some good songs here , though . tomorrow comes today , clint eastwood , gravity , 19-2000 , and left hand suzuki method are cool songs . slow country 's kind of cool , too . and dracula 's got an awesome , almost haunting sound to it , and it 's really absorbing . although it too , unfortuantely , loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it . this small collection of good songs , though , is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks . much of this cd just is n't really that good . i do n't know...this cd just seemed empty . very few meaningful tracks , lots of filler , and some really annoying and repetitive songs . some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long , mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs . clocking in at 72 minutes , ( which makes it 22 minutes ( ! ) longer than demon days ) this cd was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff . people interested in the gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up , demon days , instead of this one . if i listened to this debut cd first , i probably would n't have ended up liking this band very much . the good news about this is that the gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump ; their cds are getting better , not worse . that is a great sign for the future of this awesome band .

camera neg 782.txt this is not the best way to get started in astronomy . the low power eyepiece is fairly useful , the higher power one less so , and do n't even think of using the barlow . the maximum useful magnification for a 60mm scope is about 120-140x , assuming the objective lens is of good quality . when you use the middle and high magnifications provided with this scope , you exceed that limit and the increased image size is more than offset by breakdown . to their credit , the manufacturer has provided a reflex " red dot " finder in place of the useless 5x24 finders that plague so many similar scopes . even so , what you can expect to see in this scope is rather limited . some star clusters will be dimly visible , but galaxies and nebulae will be barely- -if at all- -visible . in a way , it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope . their upper-tier instruments are quite good , but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this . in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models . just make sure , gentle reader , to stay away from the toys . using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar . it is a learned skill . and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope . buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving . if you want to see the wonders of the sky , contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties . the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started . the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars ( decent ones are available on amazon ) , then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm ( 6-8 " ) dobsonian ; celestron 's own 6 " starhopper can be found on amazon for under $290. for more information on buying telescopes , see my encyclopedic guide on amazon : " so you want to buy a telescope .

camera neg 544.txt my wife got this for me for christmas . i was thrilled and thought it was a great idea . i charged the device and transferred pictures to it . i work in technology , so i agree with many of the other reviewers that the software is terrible - - to delete any photos , you have to delete them from the device , not the software . image quality is ok , but not good enough to be " sharing " with people . and after a few days of sorting through pictures and transferring and deleting them , it got a bit old . other than looking at it " straight-on " , nobody on either side of you can see the image . it 's back-lit , which is fine...but it does n't help much . unfortunately , the battery did n't last all that long . the device refused to charge after about two months , and eventually it died altogether . the only way to make the unit work was to plug in the usb cable ; the battery would not charge . so i contacted " support " and got a basic run-around , telling me that you " should n't charge the battery for more than 2-3 hours " at a time , and that i could request an rma to return it for replacement . warranty is no good , and it ca n't be returned . i 'm holding onto it because i 'll probably take it apart and use the internal parts to build a desktop " photocube " , so it can run off the usb cable . but i agree with others that - - even if this worked longer than 2 months - - it 's just a novelty that gets tedious quickly

software pos 558.txt i just upgraded sd v4 to sd5 and could not be happier . release 5 has had a very rocky start to say the least . i do believe they released it a bit early . fortunately i read the sd forums daily and only downloaded version 5 when it seemed the big bugs had been dealt with . i have always found this product to be the best in it 's class . best detection and moreover removal . easy to use . i 've also had the product that is typically rated number 1 and for me it is no contest which i will stick with . this is my main , real time anti spyware product . i think one big plus is their customer service availability . this is important . they are very responsive . their forums on their website are also extremely helpful . customer service is also free . this application is fast and is not a resource hog . i have a lot of confidence in it . also recently just downloaded their pc tools plus firewall...it 's another great product and it is free ! basically a good company to deal with . i believe when the dust settles from this new ( albeit too early ) release of version 5 , you will see spyware doctor attain 1st place on many tech lists 
music pos 245.txt the one song i know is a remake is " goodnight my love .

camera neg 29.txt this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position . i sent the camera for warranty service ( i had it less than 7 months ) , and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off . they claimed this happened due to physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i was just changing modes and the lens did n't retract . do n't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new . even then , do n't be surprised if they renege on the warranty . i had another a410 that did the very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service ( so i suppose it was no loss after all ) . obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside . in short , this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field . if you buy it , and plan to use it a lot , expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty ( which i 'm not doing ) soon . 
camera pos 205.txt i have used this charger & battery package for a while now in my digital slr , battery performance is excellent ! the downside is that the charger has issues : the top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get very hot when charging , it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year i have had them . if you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these , and the charger is okay , just beware that it does not charge all nimh batteries but does do most 
dvd pos 864.txt it is almost ashame that north amercian culture needs bill maher . after all , should n't honest yet entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available then it currently is ? on victory begins at home , maher creates entertainment by basically speaking his mind . maher 's central premise that the war on terrorism can be aided by what people do in the united states really is almost a common sense arguement . yet maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how he presents it , the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy that few comedians can match . maher does this by not pretending he is n't politically opinated , in fact that is what bases his comedy completely on , the rarity of straight-forward unabashed opinion . on victory begins at home he is more democrat then republican , but he openly sides with neither . instead , he rails at all presenting himself as a full person , neither liberal nor conservative , right-wing or left-wing . the end result is an engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered . there is no spin here , what maher realizes is that no spin is funny in a world full of it . with all the spin that is normally doled out by the news media , political columnists and special interest groups , know wonder we need him so much . 
dvd neg 138.txt if you have read harmon 's acting resume online , then you know she has talent , she has the training , and the ability to really play a good dramatic role if one came along . but being a mild conservative ( angie is a republican ) in liberal hollywood can useually mean that the film companies give her really medicore scripts to look at . good advice was bad advice for her . it is miscast with two annoying stars ; sheen and richards...and some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a movie . it has no redeaming values at all and angie deserves better roles then this . this movie was made by artiscan films , which recently went into bankruptcy and is now lions gate films , their films are still bad no matter the name change , and i still wait to see a better movie come to angie harmon

camera pos 605.txt at first it was a little hard to get my pictures to look as good as the samples , but i found that by re-sizing them to about an inch or so on the computer before downloading them that they show up alot better . also , the ones with higher contrast are easier to see farther away . just look at the samples that come pre-loaded to remind yourself that it is possible to get great-looking pics at a surprisingly high resolution . after a few practice downloads i was thrilled with the results . **another plus : this one came with a wall charger . most have to be plugged in to the usb to charge . the wall charger makes it perfect to share on vacation when you 're away from your computer

music neg 853.txt chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again . fftmc and bts were lush and beautiful productions . nicks latest attempts have been pathetic...from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint...even his older ' pop ' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he 's doing these days...no , we 're not saying recycle the older productions , but instead it 's a matter of putting the effort and ' originality ' in the profuctions...a signature if you will...and hey , it does n't have to pigeon hole you if done with class...yes , how the mighty have fallen.. . oh brother. . 
dvd pos 121.txt we all know the movie and story of the silence of the lambs . i reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me , it is one of the best films ever made . now , with red dragon , i give it 4 stars but i think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is... . anthony hopkins , the brilliant actor who plays hannibal lecter . i do n't think this movie would have been as good if hopkins would n't have played the role of lecter . i own the original manhunter , which is an older movie and it was good but hopkins can not be beat for the hannibal lecter role . this is a great thriller film ! ! edward norton delivers a very good performance as retired fbi agent will graham . when a series of serial killing style murders start , graham is called out of retirement to help the fbi catch the killer known as " the tooth fairy " . he eventually seeks the aid of lecter to help him find who this killer is . like silence of the lambs , we find graham visiting lecter in his maximum security facility . very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence . this movie holds true to the book with the same name . we get to see lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in s.o.t.l. without going further into all the details of the movie , i 'll just say this is a great prequel although it came after s.o.t.l. and the movie hannibal . also , ralph fiennes delivers a good performance as the red dragon . for anyone who has n't seen this movie , it 's a must see ! ! ! ! 
books neg 230.txt children love to follow instructions , step by step , and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep , drag on for hours . any adult , who cooks like this does n't cook often , cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen . for example , who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter , melts it in a pan then pours it into a ( plastic , microwave safe ) mixing bowl ? great , now there 's a pan , a knife and a cutting board to wash ! it is a children 's cookbook , so why not cut down on time spent with knives , stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave ? nice pictures , large font , recipes are great , but ( in my opinion ) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen , not a home .

books pos 251.txt jonathan glover 's book is not quite like anything you 've read on war , state terror , and genocide . the tour of twentieth-century horrors is thematic rather than chronological , organized according to the ethical issues glover wants to explore . this takes a little getting used to , but it allows the author to jump , for example , from the first world war to the cuban missile crisis , to see which lessons had been learned in the interim and which might be applied in the future . the cumulative power of glover 's pointillist technique is enormous . & quot ; humanity&quot ; combines a clear-eyed ( necessarily often gruesome ) depiction of *in*humanity with an informed and enlightening discussion of how leaders and ordinary people can change things for the better . as an examination of the psychological and existential origins of mass murder and genocide , it marks an advance on ervin staub 's classic & quot ; roots of evil , & quot ; and should be of interest to any student of modern history and politics

health pos 50.txt i 'm cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard . i 'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated , so i have to carefully prep for shaving . after years of trial and error , i 've finally settled on a good shaving cream system : cetaphil skin cleanser for a base , then kiss my face moisture shave as a supplement . for post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts , i use a product like clean&clear dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . however , the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver . with the gillette fusion power , i 've finally found the right one . i 've used gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first gulf war ( i was in the marines at the time ) . they 've gotten the job done , but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type . it does n't take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck , especially since i take forever to change blades . i dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots ( not to mention getting blood stains on my collar ) . electric shavers do n't work for me either - too hard on my skin , and i 'd have a five-o'clock shadow around 2pm . so , when i saw gillette touting their new 5-blade system , i gave it a shot . i was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers . but the fusion power is the happy exception . at first i struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end . but once i mastered that maneuver and got the battery in , i was set . it takes one aaa-battery that seems to last a decent interval ( the low-battery indicator is a nice touch ) . and even if the fusion power runs out of juice , you can still shave with it . the shaver glides over my face , and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning . the five blades really nail my beard , and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free . i also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils . my only issue is the expense of the blades . but i can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave . and most importantly , i rarely get those annoying cuts anymore ( if i do , it 's more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else ) . ultimately , the result is worth the higher price . the gillette fusion power is the best shaver i 've ever tried . highly recommended 
dvd pos 454.txt overall , this is an extremely awesome concert . i am a big fan of dt , and like pretty much all their stuff . the performance itself is pretty good , although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and jordan 's keyboard solo . other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album . if they had done more special things , it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4. other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance , but would say they did okay as far as that goes . sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand , thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him , although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands , and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them . the special features are also pretty good , but i would not buy this concert just for those , backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves . overall , i did think it was pretty cool , and i would recommend buying it if you like dream theater or just their genre of music in general

books pos 448.txt this is a nice compact hardback edition of dashiell hammett 's five novels , which he wrote between 1929 and 1934. a veteran of pinkerton detective agency in several cities , hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks , low-lives , and the seedier side of life into hard-boiled , hard-hitting detective stories . this was a time when urban corruption was the rule , and private detectives , journalists , and police officers shared information . two of these novels , & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; and & quot ; the glass key&quot ; are american classics . another , & quot ; the thin man&quot ; , inspired one of hollywood 's best-loved movie franchises . hammett 's novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place , laying bare violence , corruption , and pervasive cynicism . but they 're not dreary . the sharp prose crackles , and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it , steadfast in their own codes of conduct , their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism . these five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels . & quot ; the thin man&quot ; appeared first in & quot ; redbook&quot ; , the others in & quot ; black mask&quot ; . & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; ( 1930 ) and & quot ; the glass key&quot ; ( 1931 ) are flawless . & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; features private detective sam spade , a irresistible femme fatale , and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient gold statuette . the last pages of the book are some of the most hard-hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction . and they 're brilliant . & quot ; the glass key&quot ; explores political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed american city . oddly , the detective is the right-hand man of a crime boss . & quot ; red harvest&quot ; ( 1929 ) features the adventures of hammett 's most popular detective , the continental op , in a town called personville , or poisonville to those who know it better . the always unnamed detective for the continental detective agency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare . the novel 's opening paragraph deserves to be read several times . & quot ; the thin man&quot ; ( 1934 ) is an attempt at humor among new york 's blue-blooded , cold-blooded upper crust . hard-boiled humor is interesting in concept . but i find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny , and hammett 's style was in decline at this point . at least his characteristic cynicism wasn't . & quot ; the dain curse&quot ; ( 1929 ) is another continental op novel . this one is melodramatic , absurd , and not up to hammett 's usual standards . hammett fans should n't miss it , but others may find it pointless . i described the novels in order of descending quality . & quot ; complete novels&quot ; organizes them chronologically . five novels is a lot to pack into one book . but & quot ; complete novels&quot ; does n't resemble a door stop . it 's a handy size actually . the print is not too small , but the pages are quite thin . editor stanley marcus , a literary critic and frequent admirer of hammett 's work , has included a chronology of hammett 's life and several pages of notes on the novels in the back of the book . the chronology is informative and provides all of the apparently significant events in hammett 's life . the notes are mostly definitions of colloquialisms used in the novels , which are useful . the notes also contain an introduction to & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; , written by hammett in 1934 , in which he explains the origins of that novel 's characters . it 's quite interesting . for those who prefer to own these novels separately , vintage crime / black lizard hs published some handsome trade paperback editions . but if you want hardback and do n't mind all five novels in one volume , this is quite a nice book 
camera neg 677.txt this camcorder worked well , but i had two complaints with it . 1. on the sound track you can hear noise from the recording head moving back and forth , sounds like a woodpecker . this alone made it unacceptable or what i wanted to do . 2. i wanted high quality video , but since it records on a small dvd disk , the video is compressed before it is recorded on the disk . this causes some loss of detail in the picture , especially if you 're going to edit it and rerecord the video which i need to do . if you just want a camera to record a small dvd which you can then play in a dvd player ( and not all dvd players will play the small dvds ) this camera might be acceptable . i returned it and bought a panasonic pv-gs35minidv camcorder which uses the minidv cassette tape . much better video quality because its not compressd , and no noise from the tape drive 
dvd neg 332.txt i could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern 's classic - while the set design and special fx are state of the art , as usual for a tim burton film , the actual movie is hard to watch . why ? depp 's " performance " is chock full of ticks and mannerisms , off-putting , flat , self-absorbed , and finally , one-note . rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version , burton 's film is more horror than fantasy , often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare . while deliberate on burton 's part , that does n't make the final product any more watchable . it 's one grim , dismal , downward spiral slog . not much holidday fun , huh ? as with most of burton 's other big , expensive failures , he knows how to create a convincing world , but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and / or could care less about . the final result is a film that 's like a fragile , hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar , but hard to get attached to , much less involved with . what a waste of millions of studio $$$

dvd neg 163.txt the ab portion of the dvd is good , although i fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether . the buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set . the last one is a step-type exercise so if you do n't have something you can step up on , you ca n't do it . the dvd itself is not very professionally done . tamilee miscounts , does n't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words . abs of steel maybe , buns of steel , no way 
music neg 615.txt the best scene in the movie is the italian restaurant scene with janeane garofalo , using a wry randy quaid as her foil when she 's not ignoring him . it 's the only scene that made me laugh . the scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home , and the one preceding it when his girlfriend 's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids , are both weak . playboy dad is not interesting , and that character really should n't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie . the other dad , reiser , is uncomfortable to watch . his dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter , but that too is uncomfortable to watch . the later scene , up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him , is completely unbelievable . the fact is , that particular girl would not say those things to her dad . she does n't love him . she does n't need him at all . she 's done with him . the stupid bit about randy quaid being a talk show star after busting into rob reiner 's talk show is just dumb . that does n't happen . if you want to write a cartoon , get warner brothers to draw it for you . have the road runner in it , or bugs bunny . the film gives us comfort food at the end , with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids . the fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young , but once they hit a certain age , in double digits , you are done . daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on . kids in their teens and twenties do n't want or need anything but money from dad . fittingly , i saw this film on father 's day . to sum the whole movie up , janeane garofalo is funny , randy quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end , and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying . the script does n't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on . but it takes a subject on , so at least that 's something . it gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family 
books neg 13.txt i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring . it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters . he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for " the swede " , without letting us know who the swede really is . roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration . it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book . i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times

music neg 906.txt i deeply love the music of joni mitchell . it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you , to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it ( as i stupidly did ) . the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it ( a new mature joni ! a return to the roots ! a brilliant acoustic album ! and nonsense like these.. . ) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see ( well , hear ) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years ( except " dog eat dog " which is superb , but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it 's an ' 80s disaster ) . it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening . ok , some lyrics are quite good , but nothing compares to the joni of the ' 60s and ' 70s . so , i really do not get the point : it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say ( how painful it is to face reality ! ) , so , why should all of you praise her ? just because of what she did in the past ? ok , let us say that she was the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation ( according to me , much better than bob dylan ) and let us praise her forever because of that ; but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything she does , even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art . i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album ( and anything else from 1982 up to now - except , as i said , " dog eat dog " ) . if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell , try anything you want from the 60s and 70s . really , anything . try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins . you have to be prepared , for it could be beautifully dangerous : once you know her , you will never let her go away from your soul

books pos 473.txt this book has a lot of insights about various ways in which the ' pace of life and learning ' have since the scientific revolution accelerated . in other words it is a book which gives one much to think about . the problem is that it also suggests that given the vast increase of information available to us , the vast increase in ' possible alternatives ' for our attention , that we will probably have our minds moved away from the insights so rapidly as to not even absorb them . the obvious reply to such an intense barrage upon our consciousness , is to withdraw . and when we withdraw and close out all that is accelerating around us , we begin to try and make a pace and story of our own within ourselves . the faster we are forced to go , the slower we may need to go . i think a companion volume , or perhaps a contradictory volume should be written on all those human activities which might be aided by our ' going slower in them' . and along with this volume should be advice and recommendation of how to keep out of our life these seemingly endless intrusions which disrupt our living by our own rhythm . " run slowly , slowly horses of the night "

books pos 707.txt love letters has a very simple concept : two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage . they never look at each other . but within these letters is so much humor , love , and truth that the play will carry you away with delight . i read this play as i was browsing through a bookstore . i just wanted to read the first couple of pages since i 'd heard so much about it . after page three , i did n't want to put it down . now i 'm buying it for a friend . do n't think this play is a sappy collection of gushy girl talk or even romance-novel fodder . if you have ever been in love , you will recognize parts of yourself in this . it always stays true to its well-drawn characters , which is what makes the end so heartbreakingly wonderful

books pos 318.txt at first , i found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a christian and a catechist in the catholic church . yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story , especially since i work as a mental health professional . as i keep reading , i discovered that it was n't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope , of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child , and of the intrusive nature of the media . i particularly liked the strength mariah showed during this conflict , despite her past history of nervous breakdown . and i like the way the character of ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man . the secondary characters were all wonderful , in particular mariah 's mother and the lawyers on both side . i thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story . as with all picoult books , this was a deep and heavy novel which was n't easily breezed through , but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read !

health pos 521.txt and now a word from david lynch , as spoken by dean stockwell as doctor yueh in dune : " the tooth . the tooooootttttttth . remember the tooth .

camera neg 585.txt i have to say that i really wanted to like this camera . it takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature . it is quite compact and has a nice screen . the software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface . why 2 stars ? ok here 's the bad stuff : 1 ) in the first shipment i got , the normal mode ( non-ultra-wide angle ) did n't work . the images were garbled and almost unrecognizable . the ultra-wide images were fine . i attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange . the second v570 i got from amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me . so , i do n't think it is just a random problem . there appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that i would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem . my v570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and i use a casio exilim ex-z70. 2 ) the stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel . you have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle . also , since you have to charge the battery in the camera , you ca n't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other . for comparison , my new casio ex-z70 has a usb cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger . so , if one battery is dead i can leave it behind in the charger while i take pictures with the spare . 3 ) the movies that you take with this camera are stored in mov format instead of avi or mpeg . while it does play in most pcs if you have installed quicktime , it is not supported by my streaming media player ( d-link dsm-320rd ) and is difficult to work with in the video editor / dvd creator sw i use ( sonic mydvd ) . i ca n't say how widely mov is supported compared to avi and mpeg , but that format created problems for me . so , i applaud kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital . but i think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations

dvd pos 739.txt this is a good introduction to many off the beaten paths of america . in fact , the real star of the show , asie from the ubiquitous red ford taurus , is the scenery of america itself . the camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places that have unique characteristics . unfortunately there is no interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete coverage of each scene , but the point of the series is to give a " reader 's digest " view of places people can visit . but excellent photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are the hallmark of this series . each " trip " is actually a roundabout path that is really serveral " family vacations " combined into a one hour program . this is a great cure for cabin fever in the midst of a winter snowstorm

music neg 797.txt i remember really liking this album when it was first released , even though i could tell it was not in the same league as the real thing or angel dust . listening to the album now , i realise it is by far the worst fnm album since mike patton joined . the whole album feels very rushed , it has a sparse , raw sound , very different to angel dust 's polish . the music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like b-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums . it was a shame to see guitarist jim martin depart . he had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of fnm 's style and make up . however , being replaced ( for a short time anyway ) by trey spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work with mr bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his work here on king for a day is excellent , it 's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired . how ironic then that on such a disappointing album , fnm produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius , full of the care and effort , rhythm and melodiousness fnm were famous for . beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum , it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is fnm as you 'd expect them . another track that deserves special mention is cuckoo or caca , a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals . it 's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness fnm once held in abundance . it 's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness ( caralho voador , take this bottle , the last to know ) and 2nd rate metal ( ugly in the morning , what a day , get out ) . star a.d. could have been vintage fnm but in the end falls flat , evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like ricochet , the gentle art of making enemies and digging the grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing . however , the album does end on another note of vintage fnm - just a man is funny and catchy with patton having fun doing his tom jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not wanting it to end . patton 's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you ca n't help but feel he was a little bored here - i think his heart always really lay with the far superior mr bungle , where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material . i suppose it 's not surprising that king for a day is a largely empty affair , the departure of jim martin and the diminished presence of roddy bottum at rehearsals meant that fnm 's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to . it 's really an album for faith no more fans , it 's certainly no classic despite some classic material and i feel it was the beginning of the end for fnm , they would improve with their next album , album of the year - but only marginally .

books pos 357.txt malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail . i really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs / matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books . he almost makes the process seem easy , and maybe it is , if you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant . however , much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a " plateau'ed " or " downward spiraling " church that has been around for 100 years . the principles are easy and make sense if you have 100% support of the congregation . that 's pretty hard to do in most of the churches i 've been in that need strategic planning the most . that 's no fault of malphurs ; the book itself is a great book

music neg 750.txt the versions of " black sabbath " and " war pigs " actually comprise half of black sabbath 's appearance on the april 26 , 1970 edition of john peel 's ' sunday show . ' " black sabbath " features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially released version of the song . " war pigs " is actually " walpurgis , " an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different lyrics . incidentally , the other two songs from that broadcast , " fairies wear boots " and " behind the wall of sleep , " were released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the first pressings of the original 1997 release . all four of these tracks , while fascinating , do n't rightfully belong on this collection , as this disc intends to highlight ozzy osbourne 's career as a solo artist . for that reason , the live version of " paranoid " that appears on this set is equally unnecessary . those songs are frustrating inclusions on an ozzy osbourne greatest hits album , particularly since they come at the apparent exclusion of some of ozzy 's biggest hits and / or notable tracks such as " flying high again , " " shot in the dark , " " i do n't know , " " breaking all the rules , " or " road to nowhere . " to add to the confusion , some of the solo-era material included here is n't exactly what it purports to be . ozzy has been the subject of a number of recent legal disputes over writing and performance royalties . these disputes ostensibly prompted ozzy to reissue his back catalog in 2002 with , in some cases , re-recorded tracks . the ' blizzard of ozz ' and ' diary of a madman ' albums now feature pointlessly re-recorded rhythm parts , presumably as a snub to the original rhythm section of lee kerslacke ( drums ) and bob daisley ( bass ) , who , incidentally , wrote the lyrics to almost every ozzy solo track from ' blizzard of ozz ' through ' no more tears . ' the ' bark at the moon ' album , while not re-recorded , was most certainly remixed . it is the re-recorded versions of the ' blizzard of ozz ' and ' diary of a madman ' tracks and the remixed version of the ' bark at the moon ' track that appear on the current edition of this collection . finally , the version of " no more tears " is actually the video edit , not the album version . in addition , due to one of the disputes mentioned above , ' the ultimate sin ' album was not selected for remastering in 2002 and has subsequently been dropped from ozzy 's catalog . that album 's biggest hit , " shot in the dark , " which appeared on the original 1997 release of this collection , has now been replaced with " miracle man " from ' no rest for the wicked . ' along these lines , the ' just say ozzy ' live ep and the double-disc live album , ' live and loud , ' both of which contain a live version of " shot in the dark , " have also been deleted from ozzy 's catalog . not even ' the essential ozzy osbourne , ' a double-disc collection covering ozzy 's entire solo career , features a single song from ' the ultimate sin . ' the ultimate sin , indeed . my recommendation is to avoid this collection ( and the 2002 remasters ) and instead search for the 1995 remasters or , better yet , search for the original albums on vinyl 
books neg 581.txt written in cartoon format , i thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight , dry , biography of scientists . however , it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids . the cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known , so using it as an initial reading is impossible . further , some content is offensive . on the second page of cartoons , a scientist is walking along a bridge , thinking , when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump , saying , " no woman is worth committing suicide over . " the pictures show a scantily-clad woman ( with bare bottom in one frame ) that he is now picturing in his mind . irrelevant and inappropriate ! plus , i did n't have to go far to find swear words in the captions . yikes ! my kids will never see this book ! it is not even appropriate for high-school age kids . ( in fact , it is n't even funny to adults ! 
camera neg 145.txt polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image . i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare , but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some " pop " out of clouds . there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs . for instance , linear vs. circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs. price . if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers are designed to work with those features . linear polarizers has their uses , but they are manufactured differently and may not work . unless you are certain , just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film . i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera . most of the time , when it comes to filters ; you get what you pay for . does that mean you need an expensive polarizer ? of course not , just be sure to get the right filter for your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting . spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money by using step down rings . currently i use the hoya pro1 filters , as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier . the weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly . i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me . when it came down to the images , at times i would see a browning tint on my photos . the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 , but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it is canon , it must be quality . " since then i have replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . pros : can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons : bulky and heavy not neutral color balance 
dvd neg 862.txt the strange and baffling career of cuba gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of denzel 's training day . unfortunately , cuba 's not denzel and this movie is way below the quality of day . filled with enough foul language to fill the pacific ocean , the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie , filled with bad cops- --where 's the good ones ? clifton collins jr. , so good in capote , is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of cuba who is going to testify in internal affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust . all though this cuba swaggers like a rap star and collins has to try and act tough with him . there 's an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film 
music pos 118.txt rem has had a helluva lot of hits , and has remained a radio staple and has been a big influence on later bands . this 18-track album does a good job for its length , but i really do feel a 2-cd hit package is warranted . the biggest omissions are " shiny happy people , " " it 's the end of the world as we know it , " and " this one goes out to the one i love . " it would n't surprise me if the band did n't really like these songs and would rather not include them in their greatest hits collection . however , there are a few other more minor hits i know from them that are missing , like " radio free europe . " i just ca n't think of other titles right now , but there are more than a few other omissions too . many of the minor hits that are included here , thankfully , are very good and will grow well on you : " the great beyond , " " bad day , " " all the way to reno , " " e-bow the letter , " and " imitation of life " are songs i have n't heard enough of and i 'm glad they are on this collection . still , i hear rem is coming out with another compilation and i imagine it will be more complete ; i suggest waiting for that album when it comes out

software neg 671.txt having used turbo tax since 1990 i feel that i am qualified to comment on it . i have also used quicken , quicken deluxe , quicken home & business , quickbooks pro 2003 & quickbooks premier contractors edition . the turbo tax product seems to get more user un-friendly each year . the navigation features do not allow as much mobility thru the program as they did in the late nineties and early 2000's . like i said i was using quickbooks pro 2003 until tax time last year . i purchased turbo tax home & business like i had for the past 4 years , and really got a shock when i found out that it would not import my data from quickbooks pro 2003. three year old software that was not compatible with turbo tax in 2006 ( actually 2005 tax year ) . i ended up purchasing quickbooks premier contractors edition 2006 ( $280+ ) in order to upgrade just to get my taxes done . intuit in my opinion is a perfect example of major corporate greed . i am done with them and will purchase taxcut this year 
music neg 352.txt this cd is the worst " comedy " cd i have ever heard . yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious ? ? ? ? ok , i 've come to the conclusion , the only people writing positive reviews on amazon must be the people trying to sell the junk . i 've seen this guy on some tv shows , and on comedy central , and he 's a somewhat funny guy , but it is painful to listen to this cd . you can feel the awkwardness of the crowd , not knowing if or when to laugh . and it continues throughout the entire cd . there do n't seem to be any jokes on the cd at all . it is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being . do n't believe me ? then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk , and see for yourself . like my review title says , do not read the positive reviews . just read the negative ones , and decide how credible they seem . then make your decision to buy or not buy 
music neg 636.txt it just amazes me what a joke the music industry has become . nowadays anyone can become a singer take for instance : ashlee simpson , lindsay lohan , and now paris hilton ? lmao ! no seriously though , i 'm still totally not sure how paris hilton became so famous . yes , i know she 's the hilton hotel heiress , but i 'm not sure why the media gives her so much attention . all she did was live off her family fortune , but now thanks to that fortune , she was able to get the right contacts , to make her own record label called " heiress records " which is a sub-label of warner bros . after a reality show series , modeling career , a sex tape , and a couple of roles in a few movies , what did she think to herself ? i think i want to be a singer now ? apparently . and thats how this flaming pile of garbage came about . " stars are blind " is her first single off her debut album " paris " and let me tell you it 's nothing new or original . the song has kind of a ska beat , which i really do n't think much of . her voice sounds like when you inhale helium from a balloon , and the lyrics are mediocre . sorry paris , but you failed miserably as a musician . leave this profession for the people that really have the talent 
health pos 671.txt i bought this model 7 years ago for over $100 and it is still running strong although i only use it to clip a small family dog . nevertheless , forget the cheap vibrating ' magnetic motor ' clippers - not enough power and the buzzing bothers the animal . this clipper uses a superior rotating motor that is more powerful and provides a consistent cutting action . in fact , with the right ( replaceable ) blade , you could use this to cut kids hair as well . it stays cool , unlike the magnetic motor design . use with oster kool lube and you will never have problems getting a clean cut . it uses blades by oster so there is a lot of versatility possible 
music neg 461.txt in the classic and disturbing 1972 movie deliverance , lewis ( burt reynolds ) gives this ominous warning to ed ( jon voigt ) : " machines are going to fail . systems are going to fail . then.. . survival . " what , i wonder , will richard d . james ( a.k.a. aphex twin , a.k.a. afx ) do when the machines fail ? it 's been nearly five years since his underappreciated album drukqs , where we got a tantalizing possible answer to this question : the plaintive , lovely , satie-esque acoustic keyboard nocturnes intermingled among the abstract , frantic electronic soundscapes throughout its sprawling duration . [another intriguing solution was proposed on the album acoustica : alarm will sound performs aphex twin...] chosen lords , rdj 's first proper cd release since then , is actually a collection of various tracks from his " analord series " of overpriced , elaborately packaged 12-inch vinyl singles that he 's been cranking out over the last year or so . those who were put off by the excesses and overt eccentricity of drukqs may hail these cryptically titled , drum-machine laden compositions as a " return to greatness . " indeed , afx is certainly reviving a more compact , accessible ( for him ) , and straightforward style here , with comparatively regular ( though not quite danceable ) rhythms and those comforting underlying simple synthesizer melodies . i have to say , though , that there 's a disappointing and somewhat melancholy sense here of a great musical mind spinning its wheels . by returning to such familiar ground he seems to be setting up systems and letting them run their course in an almost cynical way , without any of the maniacal glee that was once part of his singular musical personality on unforgettable releases like come to daddy , windowlicker , the richard d . james album , and , yes - - drukqs . notably lacking are the voices that once regularly appeared in his productions - - true , they were usually rather unsettling , distorted , and manipulated voices , but at least they added some welcome humanity . also missing are those rare but beautiful moments of repose ( ballads ? ) such as " flim , " " nannou " and the striking piano interludes on drukqs . in the end , chosen lords , while an undeniably interesting and expertly produced collection of electronic music , is nonetheless a sterile , static , joyless affair . if it inspires any emotion at all , it will probably be pity and sadness as you listen to a possible musical genius coasting along without exploring any new directions for the first time in his otherwise remarkable career . yes , i 'm afraid the machines have failed richard d . james , and i sincerely hope he can survive in this cold and remote musical wilderness of his own creation. . 
software neg 119.txt the description of this product on the amazon site does not match what i received . like another reviewer mentioned , the product was actually shipped from the uk so it took longer , and several features listed as being in the product are not there , specifically , exporting / saving of loops is not allowed , and there is no library of 1000+ loops included either . it seems to me to be basically like a demo version . also , even though it was advertised as being new in the box , all i got was what looks like a ( used ) cd with no manual or cd key - so much for upgrading later ! i am returning it . the sku should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out 
books pos 374.txt this book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13 , 000 years across the continents . diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume . the impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from new guinea named yali . yali 's question was , " why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to new guinea , but we black people had little cargo of our own ? " reading the book , i think i gulped at this point . this sounds like a classic , loaded question . it sounds disturbingly close to why have we ( europe and its former colonies ) succeeded where they have failed . diamond does not descend into that territory though , but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely . there are references to a culture 's success in industrializing or condensing populations that diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing , for instance . the advantages of a hunting / gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast asia . this history can probably be described ( or perhaps is most successful ) as based around environmental causation ( as opposed to the racial / ethnic / social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing ) . descriptions of climate ( note : that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age ) , longitudinal or latitudinal axes , elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity . still , it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title . guns . europe 's refinement of this technology was based on china 's innovations with gunpowder . today 's dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated . as an interesting counterpoint , japan had owned more and better guns in c . 1600 ce , than any country in the world . samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology . japan would n't resume manufacture until mid 19th century . obviously , there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry 's influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today . germs . epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who did n't survive . smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities . epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals ( and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate ) . interesting note : the emperors of the mayan and incan civilizations both succumb to disease ( likely smallpox ) rather than guns . steel . technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities . a hunter-gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining , as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas . diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter-gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society , where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses . there are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things . first , there appears to need to be sustainable farming . many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region ( where today we invade , suck oil , and force the conquered to endure freedom ) . the western asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop . as a complete side note , the genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming . another factor in the civilizing of eurasia is the landmass itself . compared to africa and the americas , eurasia is mainly west-east axis versus north-south . movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal . something like corn ( maize ) which was domesticated in central americas took a very long time to make it to north america because of geography . llamas and guinea pigs ( which could be useful for pack animals and food ) never made it north . conversely , all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle , horses , pigs were able to spread from one tip of asia to the opposite tip of europe . to answer yali 's question , some of the answer is luck . africa , australia and the americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that eurasia had . some other is environmental determinism , where you are helps make up who you become . for going forward , diamond cites transportation , communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future . after word : harpers magazine tackles an issue that was brought up , but not as fully developed here , that of pre-clovis native american discoveries ( pronouncements ) , knowingly confronting a loaded racial / ethnocentric question in a folio called " might white of you : are american archaeologists white supremacists ? " the archaeological records supports people living in the americas since about 9000-11000 bce . there are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date , but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive . one wonders if the pre-clovis discovery ( especially all the business about " caucusoid " skulls ) , is n't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide .

music pos 364.txt as a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music i was wary of a cd claiming to be a hybrid - too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid . i need not have worried - tim o'brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys i 've followed for some time . not only do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks , mostly songs , are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions . there are superb performances all round , vocally from o'brien with guests paul brady , maura o'connell , kathhy mattea , del mccoury etc and musicians altan , frankie gavin , jerry douglas , earl scruggs , seamus egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh , acoustic and vital , requiring no production gimmicks or effects . standout songs for me personally are & quot ; mountaineer is always free&quot ; , & quot ; lost little children&quot ; , & quot ; wandering&quot ; and & quot ; john riley&quot ; although there is not a weak track on the cd . it is obvious that for tim o'brien this has been a labour of love . if you like acoustic music , from any tradition , either side of the atlantic , you 'll love it . several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant

dvd neg 412.txt the first was one of the best thrillers ever , with clever suspence , good characters , decent acting and awesome effects . this one is.. . meh . why must you make a sequel to a huge success hit and turn the franchise into a straight-to-video series ? what 's the bloody point ? now there are some good parts . the rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent , but you know , that does n't even save it . this movie is a annoying , pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily love . it is so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke . the characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs . i do n't even know them well . all they do is scream , run around in the cube rooms and cannot keep their mouths shut . i also really hate the effects in this one as well . they felt like they were over-used . there is even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly done it was . the direction is ok , but when it comes to adding wierdness , it 's too much . i do n't understand the story , there 's a strange sex-scene which a cube movie does not need . cube is about suspence . this one is just about adding too much effects , a four-dimensional cube and trying to make itself look better than the first one . you do n't need that stuff . if you wanted to make a sequel better than the first , add something original , do n't take itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original . but no , you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene which is not cool because if it 's a cube movie , you do n't need nudity . overall , if you wanna kill off some time by watching this crap , go ahead . i know you like watching people getting killed in unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes . if you 're a fan of cube , dont ' bother . acting : 3 / 10 ugh , do n't get me started . these actors have bad acting skills and i hope they die . gore factor : 4 / 10 cgi gore ? ! come on ! ? t&a : 1 / 10 a cube movie does n't need nudity and they do n't know that because they do n't know cube . direction : 7 / 10 andrzej sekula did have some visual eye in some parts . i did enjoy a few scenes and i dug the rooms , but you know , i ca n't say he 's a great director . he turned the franchise with straight-to-video written all over it . bottom line : if you wanna watch , go ahead , then you 'll be sorry . this movie is just sad . it does n't try anything to impress you because it 's idiotic . lets hope andrzej sekula learned his lesson and should never do a sequel to an impressive indipendent film again 
software pos 757.txt i bought bhg deluxe 7.0 software to plan an addition . i talked to the companies and shopped around before purchasing . i did not talk to imsi about floor plan 3d , i gave up after trying to get through to a human . i would bet a guess the software is as good as imsi 's telephone skills . i talked to punch software and was warned away from their product by their own tech as i have integrated video on my computer . apparently you need a video card with a minimum of video memory to render drawings with any usable speed using punch software . punch software 's loss , not mine as that 's a ridiculous issue for a consumer software product . chief architect offered a money back guarantee for their better homes and gardens products , even if purchased via vendors like amazon . i 'll keep this better homes and gardens home designer deluxe software , even though it does have it 's annoying quirks . even for a lesser package from the pro version , the library of items it very limited . i would guess there are quite a few more in the pro version , but it is odd to not include more of the most standard items that many home owners would need when laying out a home . you learn to just use a nearly matched symbol to fill the space , even though it is not the correct symbol or size of item . since i am not interested in the 3d view , this is not a big issue for me . the item i needed most was floorplanning . 3d modeling is an extra item that i may play with , but is not essential for me personally . if you are truly interested in the 3d aspect , this is an issue . i would recommend visiting the product forum to see what is the best choice . [...] for quick and easy floor plan software with a few extras , this software does better than ok . no experience necessary , and the short tutorial videos will get you started quickly . i have issues with not being able to have more control of wall types , and there are some odd roof design limitations even for a mid to low priced consumer package . these are annoying enough to urge an upgrade to pro if you want more control of all aspects . since i will be laying out the floor plan , then turning it over to an architect with real softare , it 's not a problem for me . i have had a few restarts due to drawings getting all wild and messed up , but by ignoring the autosaved drawings , i was able to go back to my last manually saved drawing and start from a known good point . this software does have upgrade options to download from the company site . just like any good software company , they do provide spftware patches to download . i would definately recommend this software as a quick way to do floor plans . adding walls , doors , windows , and other items is very simple . just do n't plan on perfection , as it 's based on prefabbed walls and is limited to whole inches , not fractions . angles are an issue as well . if you need specific angles , this is not the package , it does preset increments only . i wish it had default preferences a user could select as well . being able to preset your roofing style preferences or other items would eliminate quite a bit of redo's . i hope the software companies read these reviews . there is alot of good information on how to improve the products .

camera pos 464.txt i always say that there is technology you can use and technology you can impress others with . this model helps you do both . you have a nice 5.1 mp still camera and mpegmovie4tv video . the very fact that you have a camera which you can take both still pictures and video is huge . i never had a video camera before because i hate to carry two camera and a big camera case , so this was the obvious solution . i realize that instead of embracing the moment ( for which they need the memory ) most people often juggle between cameras . cons : * sometimes people might confuse it with camera phone * buttons are harder to find * software is not the best * wish had more zoom pros : * convince * compact * battery lasts long * flash is good * video sound quality is good i wonder why this model has not swept the market - another story of good product and mad marketing

language ` ` ` ` ambition is the death of thought'''  these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago ( but most people have yet to find this out ) .dennett , though he has been a philosopher for some40 years , is one them. it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist , john searle , studied under famous wittgensteinians ( searle with john austin , dennett with gilbert ryle ) but searle got the point and dennett did not . dennett is a hard determinist ( though he trys to sneak reality in the back door ) , and perhaps this is due to ryle , whose famous book ' the concept of mind ' ( 1949 ) continues to be reprinted . that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine . dennett enjoys making the mistakes wittgenstein , ryle ( andmany others since ) have exposed in detail . byaccident , just before this book , i had read ' 'the minds i' ' , which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in 1981. they made some bad mistakes ( see my review ) , and saddest of all , they reprinted twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess- --nagel's  ` what is like to be a bat ? ` and an early version of john searle's  chinese room argument explaining why computers do n't think. nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat 's mind would be like. searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize thinking and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does ( eg , it can translate chinese without understanding it ) . likewise , we lack a clear test for recognizing what countsas good vs bad- -or just intelligible- - for many philosophical and scientific concepts. our use of the words consciousness , choice , freedom , intention , particle ,  thinking ,  determines , wave , cause , happened , event ( and so on endlessly )  are rarely a source of confusion but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy ( and anydiscussion detached from the environment in which language evolved )  chaos reigns. wittgenstein was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid this . unfortunately , he died inhis prime , his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of how the mind ( language ) worksand he never wroteany popular books , so understanding of his work is restricted to a very few . searle is one of the world 's leadingphilosophers and has written manyextremely clear and highly regarded articles and books , some of which have pointed out the glaring defects in dennett's work.his review ` ` consciousness explained away' ' of dennetts 1991 book ` ' consciousness explained''  and his book ''the mystery of consciousness' ' are very well known , and show , in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing , why neither dennett ( nor any of the hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic ) havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem- -ie , how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things , but it isclear that we are nowhere near it now. dennett has mostly ignored his critics but has favored searle with vituperative personal attacks.searle has been accused by dennett and others of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is ( mostly ) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious , thinks , etc , . he just points out that we do n't have any idea how this happens . searle characterizes as ' 'intellectualpathology' ' , the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. dennett repeats his mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of the book , where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how !  unsurprisingly , there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire book.there arehowever , many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is. like most people , it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the world . they are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30 's , and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with. dennett says ( p98 ) that his view is compatibilism , ie , that free will ( whichi hopewe can equate with choice ) is compatible with determinism ( ie , that ''there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future'' --p25 ) . he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. however , the whole book is smoke and mirrors by means of which choice , in the sense we normally understand it , disappears and we are left with ` ` choice ` ` , which is something we cannot choose. naturally , this echoes the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ` ` consciousness explained ` ` . it is remarkable that , at a time when we are just beginning to reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a single neuron works ( or how an atom works for that matter ) , that anyone should think they can make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain its most complex phenomena. please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein from the opening quote : ' ' and what's more , this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent , because , insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see ` the limits of human understanding ' , theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these . ` ` the relation between language ,  thought and reality is extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. if one is very , very careful , some understanding is possible , but dennett throws caution to the winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. there are at least 3 different topics here ( evolution of our brain , choice and morality ) and dennett tries vainly to weld them together into a coherent account of how freedom evolves from the deterministic crashing of atoms. there is , however , no compelling reason to accept that bouncing atoms ( or his favorite example , the game of life running on a computer ) are isomorphic with reality. he knows that quantum indeterminacy ( or the uncertainty principle ) is a major obstacle to determinism however defined ( and has been taken by many as an escape to freedom ) but dismisses it due to the fact that such events are too rare to bother with. by extension ,  its unlikely that any such event will happen now or even in our whole lifetime in our brain , so we appear to be stuck with a determined brain ( whatever that may be ) . however , the universe is a big place and its been around a long time ( perhaps forever ) and if even one such quantum effect occurs it would seem to throw the whole universe into an indeterminate state. the notion ' 'there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future' ' cannot be true if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur- -in this case there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. this recalls one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics- -each instant our universe is branching into infinitely many universes . he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice . this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness ( or any other emergent phenomenon ) . if so , they will definitely win at least one nobel prize , for not only will they have explained consciousness , they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence ( how higher order properties emerge from lower ones ) . so , they would have to solve the ' easy ' problem ( to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty ) and the ' hard ' one ( what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc ? ) . and while they are at it how about also doing the impossible- -an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain . it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable , even for one atom or a vacuum , as it would require an infinite amount of computer time . but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer . he starts off on the first page appealing to the laws of physics for protection against fantastic notions such as immaterial souls , but physics is made of notions just as fantastic ( uncertainty ,  entanglement , wave / particle duality , schrodinger 's dead / alivecat etc ) and as feynmann said many times ` ` nobody understandsphysics ! ' ' many think nobody ever will . on pg 2 he says our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and on pg 2 to3 that our personality differences are due to how our ' 'robotic teams are put togther , over a lifetime of growth and experience . ` `  this is a bald dismissal of human nature , of the abundant evidence that our differences are to a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early childhood , and is typical of his constant confused wandering back and forth between determinism and environmentalism . on page 9 he notes that free will is a problem and our attitudes to it make a difference , but for whom ?  nobody but philosophers. we make choices. what 's the problem ?  one has to step outside life to experience a problem and then everything becomes a problem. what are consciousness ,  pain ,  yellow , intention , matter , quarks , gravity etc. ?  i doubt that anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their interactions with people or their decision making processes due to their thinking about choice. this shows that there is something strange about such questions. wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are different. there are games for language connected with the cognitive templates for decisions or seeing colors etc , and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. decoupled modes permit thinking about the past , planning for the future ,  guessing the mental states of others , etc , but if one takes the results in the wrong way and starts to think ` ' john will try to steal my wallet' ' , rather than just imagining that john might do it , confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode , enter the realm of pathology. some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen this way- -they lose control of which mode they are in , eg , notbeing able to see the difference between the motives people have and the motives they might have . one can then see much of the philosophizing people do as operating in these decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them the differences from the normal mode. normal mode- -eg , what is that lion doing- - was undoubtedly the first one evolved and decoupled modes- -what did that lion do last time or what does he intend to do next- -evolved later. this was probably never a problem for animals- -any animal that spent too much time worrying about what might happen would not be very successful contributing to the gene pool. it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed culture and began degeneratinggenetically , could large numbers of people survive with genes that led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes. hence , we have philosophy and this book , which is mostly about running the decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results in a book for other people to use to run their engines in decoupled mode . ' let us alter wittgenstein 's quote to read : ' 'as longas there continues to be a verb ' to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as ' to eat ' and ' to drink ' , as long as we continueto talk of freedom of action , of saying i wish i had done otherwise , etc. , etc. , people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up. ' ' as withmost philosophy books , nearly every page ,  often every paragraph , changes from one type of language game to another without noticing that now one would have to be joking or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc , and not actually intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the world. on page 10 he says we count on free will for the whole way of thinking about our lives , like we count on food and water , but who ever , outside philosophy , standing in front of lunch counter full of food , ever thinks how fine it is that they have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral water ?  even if i want to be a serious compatibilist and try thinking this in decoupled mode , i have to exit and enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. only then can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have happened if i had not had the ability to make a real choice. wittgenstein noted how pretend games are parasitic on real ones ( this is not a trivial observation ! ) . the ability to engage in very complex decoupled scenarios is already evident in 4 year old children. so i would say that normally , nobody counts on having choice ,  but rather we just choose. on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive basics. he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of choice ,  and that ` ' it appears to be a stable and ahistorical construct , as eternal and unchanging as arithmetic , but it is not . ' ' and on page 13- - ''it is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs'' . the whole thrust of cognitive psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning , deciding , promising ,  resenting ,  etc , but that these are built-in functions of the inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously and start running in very early childhood. there is no evidence that they change as we grow , or are in any way subject to our beliefs , only that they mature just as our body does. on pg 14 he suggests its probable that our having free will depends on our believing we have it ! do we believe we see an apple , feel a pain , are happy ?  the language game of belief is very different from that of knowing. we can believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we take it out and look at it we ca n't meaningfully then say that we still believe it ( except as a joke etc. ) . the inference engine can run in decoupled ( belief )  mode so we can imagine havingchoices or making them , but in life we just make them and it is only in very odd situations we can say that we believe we made a choice. but dennett is saying thisis the universal case. if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else- -consciousness ,  seeing , thinking , etc. if we take this seriously ( and he says ' the serious problems of free will ' ) then we are getting into trouble and if we actually try to apply it to life , then madness is minutes away . . on page 65 et seq . , he discusses causation , intention and the ` informal predicates ' that we use to describe atoms etc , but cognitive resarch has shown that we describe all objects with a limited number of ontological categories which we analyse with our intuitive physics modules and that when agents ( ie animals or people or things like them- -ie , ghosts or gods ) are involved we use our concepts ( engines ) for agency , intuitive psychology , social minds , etc to decide how to behave. there is almost certainly no causation module but rather it will involve all of these and other inference engines , depending on the precise situation . discussing possibility and necessity is much easier if one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive physics ,  agency , ontological categories etc. of course there is no mention here of wittgenstein 's many incisive comments on causation , intention , deciding , nor of searle 's now classic works on intention and social reality . he spends much time on ainslie 's book ' breakdown of will ' , in which is discussed the hyperbolic discounting faculties ( ie , inference engines ) by which we evaluate probable outcomes . hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism , emotion and economics , but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published . it was bingham 's idea , amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson ( 1992 ) that cooperation was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches that areobligatory and promising. indeed they are , and in fact they are standard parts of economic , evolutionary and cognitive theory , but unfortunately ,  he makes little reference to the other work in these fields . all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them . he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. onpg 216 he says that making oneself so that one could not have done otherwise is a key innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free will , and that we can only be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive to opportunities . but where this ability resides is not revealed for several chapters !  dennett has a penchant for hiding his ideas in a massive amount of rather irrelevant text. again , he gets things backwards , as there is a vast body of very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and these are not provided by some part of our conscious self , but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the engines. as he notes , hundreds of experiments with the prisoner 's dilemma and related protocols have shown how easy it is to manipulate people 's choices and that their calculations are not conscious and deliberate at all. when the situation is manipulated to make them conscious , they are much slower and less reliable . so , there has been constant pressure of natural selection to make the engines fast and automatic and inacessible to deliberate thought . dennett says ` we make ourselves ' so that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis of morality and choice. the evidence would seem to be exactly the opposite. our inference engines give us basic moral intuitions and we generally act in accord with the results. if we or others do not we feel guilt , outrage , resentment etc ,  then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.our genes make us so we ca n't ( mostly ) do otherwise , not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it . we can often choose to do otherwise but our own intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval usually serve to limit our choices. these intuitions evolved in small groups between 50 , 000 and some millions of years ago. in the modern world the intuitions are often not to our advantage and the social controls weak. this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world . on pg 225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will as ' 'a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making ( from certain angles ) ' ' . he claims that thisplays all the valuable roles of free will but lacks some ( unspecified )  properties possessed by traditional free will. the smoke is thick but i am pretty sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. he insists ( top pg 226 ) that his naturalistic account of decision making leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility , but making ourselves so we could n't do otherwise does not seem to describe the way we actually function ,  nor does it seem to leave any room for morality , as that would seem to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise . he does not propose any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary or forced and i doubt he could do so. normally if someone asks us to move our hand , we know what counts as having a choice ,  but , typical of philosophers ,  i expect that regardless of whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position . at this point he also starts his discussion of libet 's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time . on page 253 et seq . , he sneaks in his definition of conscious will- -the ' 'brains user illusion of itself'' ' which has as one of its main roles providing ' 'me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times ` ` . and ` ` illusory or not , conscious will is the persons guide to his or her own moral responsibility for action . ` `  he says the trick we need is to see that ` ` i ` '  control what is happening inside the ' 'simplification barrier'' ... ' 'where decision making happens'' . ` ` mental events' ' become conscious by ' 'entering into memory'' . ' 'the process of self description... is what we are'' . the crucial thing is that choice is possible because the self is distributed over space ( the brain ) and time ( memories ) . he realizes this is going to leave many incredulous ( everyone who can follow this and really understands ! ) . ' 'i know that many people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. it seems to them to be a trickwith mirrors ,  some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness , and the real self , out of the picture just when it was about to be introduced . ''  many will say he took the words out of their mouth , but i would say it 's incoherent and thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole universe ( making the obvious extensions of such claims ) was gone long beforewegot this far. on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals ! this is a stunning denial of human nature ( ie , genetics and evolution ) coming from the person who wrote ' darwin 's dangerous idea' ' ! presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space ( the brain and other people ) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness ( line 6 from bottom ) . he says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain ( you will have to suffer through ' consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either ) . though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology , he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades ( social mind , intuitive psychology , coalitional intuitions etc ) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts . if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture , thats ok , but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes . we are also told here that r&d ( by which he means evolution here , but other things elsewhere ) has given us the self and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality . i am sure that he will get little agreement on this . it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates ( and earlier ) long before spoken language ( though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain ) . he continues ` ` morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago ` ` which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake ! and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes , which is an amazing ( and totally incorrect ) thing to say , even if he was only referring to memes . on pg 260 he claims that because we do not comprehend our ' 'bland dispositions to cooperate' ' ,  they mean nothing to us , but it is the operation of our templates that is everything to us. there is ample evidence that if one of them is damaged a person cannot function properly as a social being ( eg , autism ) . i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think . he also says here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them . this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology . i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions , like all the templates , are accessible to consciousness . we may decide our cheating was justifiable , or forgive someone else 's cheating , but we still know it was cheating ( ie , we cannot change the engine ) . i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings . another issue is that as culture developed , one had to make many important or ' moral type ` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer . on pg 267 he says that we now replace our ` free floating rationales ' ( probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines ) with reflection and mutual persuasion . and on pg 286 he says that it is a child 's upbringing - -demanding and giving reasons- - that affects moral reasoning . again , he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research- -the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing . we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self , which takes responsibility . it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition . on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education ( memory ) and sharing . it 's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments . on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between ' ought'and ' is ' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago- -ie , they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people . he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes ( eg see ' the blank slate ' ) . he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology , but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion . this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like ' praiseworthy ' were shaped over millennia by culture , while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms . on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess ( evolutionarily stable strategy ) can produce morality . his idea here is that genetic ` r&d ` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture ( memetics ) produces variations and clarifications . i would say that we all know , and much research has made clear , that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases . culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings . the last part of the book is mostly concerned with moral culpability. he refers to the legal classic by hart and honore , which i started reading 30 years ago since it 's authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein. dennett tells us that we have control over our own morality and that thinking about morality will improve us. but , there seems no justification whatever for this view in this book . there is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that has no connection with philosophy - and there is not a hint of spirituality in this entire book- -another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. i find more wisdom about how to be free and moral in any of osho 's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy . one rarely finds spiritually and morally advanced people teaching at universities. there is no sign here , nor in anything he has done , that dennett is morally superior. after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them . it seems clear that , like all of us , he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines . so , how much opportunity is there to improve our morality ?  it seems clear ( eg , see pinker 's ` the blank slate ` ) that most of our behaviour is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment , in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties . on average , maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior ( variations are the only thing we can study ) is due to our own efforts. the moral choices that matter most today are those affecting the fate of the world. but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect . how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is . and if one did , we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc. but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking , coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is ! and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first . to return to the quote at the beginning- - 'ambition is the death of thought' . indeed- -though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts 
dvd neg 1.txt i expected so much more from this movie , i guess since the cast included two of my favorite actors ( jolie & washington ) and also had the always on point queen latifah as well . i watched with full expectation to absolutely love this movie , but i walked away bitter with shattered expectations . first off i will say that latifah was wonderful here and she proved as the only reason i smiled on occasion during this movie experience . washington and jolie on the other hand were so unbelievable ( especially washington who really strained in this role ) that i was constantly asking myself " do i really like these two ? " and i had to remind myself of movies like ' gia ' and ' training day ' to answer with a resounding " yes ! " the film follows a rookie cop ( jolie ) as she helps a quadriplegic ex-cop lincoln ( washington ) track down a serial killer mimicking the killings detailed in a book called ' the bone collector' . the ending is really annoying since the revelation of the killer , while not who you 'd pinpoint , is not of any significance and so it manages to stir up absolutely no emotion whatsoever . it 's like " oh so he / she did it...interesting " ...and i 'm bored . i 'd skip this one for it becomes generic within the first five minutes and stays that way until the credits finish rolling 
software neg 298.txt after years of e-filing fees being included with the purchase price , it would have been more forthcoming for turbotax to put a large sticker on the front of their box alerting buyers to the price that they will pay for e-filing each return . i lost the value of my entire state return - and then some - through e-filing fees : $44.95 ( plus tax ) for the program , $16.95 ( plus tax ) for each return e-filed ( i filed two ) and a little bonus fee to the company that handles the [credit card] transaction ( that fee is never quoted in the program and i will have to wait for my credit card statement to find out what that is ) . in addition , anyone who chooses to have the fees deducted from his / her refund has to pay an additional $30. the product does what it says . but , for the cost , and less-than-honest way in which the change occured ( it almost seemed deceitful - hence the single star rating ) , i would have preferred to have given my money to my friendly neighborhood accountant . people expect change , even if they do n't like it . but , suprises that cost customers money are never welcome and drive customers away . surely the marketing / advertising gurus can think of a way to alert the customer of a significant change such as this and even put a " positive " spin on it . " filing fees only $16.95 [per return] - less than the cost of a tax professional . . . " no more turbotax for me

dvd pos 202.txt this dvd does not claim to contain a debate about the origins of christianity ; it discusses an alternate viewpoint ( as dan brown reminds us " the winners write the history books " ) this dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we have been raised with ; esp . the idea of god as male , and the idea of women being unworthy of church leadership . this dvd includes interviews with dan burstein , henry lincoln , martin lunn , lynn picknett , clive prince , dr. karen ralls , dr. james robinson , and margaret starbird . i particularly liked margaret starbird 's interviews - she describes how when she first read " holy blood , holy grail " , she found it blasphemous because she had been raised a loyal catholic . but afterward , she had religious experiences regarding the content of that book which lead her to research mary magdalene and write " the woman with the alabaster jar " . she comes across as very rational , sensible and even heroic . it takes courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority . i thought dan burstein also made some very good points with his discussions about the lives and customs of jewish people during the time jesus lived . i think this dvd is an important reminder that just because you have been taught something all your life - that does n't mean it is necessarily the truth . to be truly alive is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live

music pos 27.txt this outstanding effort by prince consists of mostly spare jazzy r&b tunes , driven by incredibly loose , free-flowing live instrumentation . i could only begin to tell you about the stylistic variety on this album . with the three disc format there is a lot to absorb , and the third disc really can largely be done without , but the first two truly do rank amongst his best work . it should also be noted how especially romantic prince is on this album . this album was made around the time that he entered into his first marriage , and it shows because this c.d. is overflowing with outstanding romantic ballads . most of his albums only contain one or two ballads , so if you 've been longing for an album that includes more , then this album should really appeal to you . this c.d. does not fit into the " standard " prince " mold " ( i know that it is perhaps a bit oxymoronic to speak of a " prince mold " but his personal signature is not quite as bold on this album as it is on many of his other works , even those that are admittedly not as good ) . the reason for this is that prince follows rather than leads on a good portion of this album . the fact that there are two covers on the first disc alone shows that prince was in the mood to do what was being done instead of doing something new ( he covers songs by bonnie raitt and the stylistics ) which is unsual for this constant innovator , but this album is so great because he is so skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else . one minor problem that i notice is that it seems that on a few songs particularly on the first disc , prince just does n't pay much attention to the lyrics . there are too many generic r&b come-ons and cheesy cliche 90 's catch phrases such as " gettin ' your groove on ' , and prince is much too clever , witty , and creative to resort to such things . but , really that is just a minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding throughout the first two discs . and then , he has songs such as " soul sanctuary " and " let 's have a baby " which are two of the most well-written ballads that i 've heard from him . " in this bed i scream " is just magnificent both lyrically and musically . he takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way . this clever , poetic , and romantic track has an infectiously catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance floor . other highly impressive moments include the high powered funk of " we gets up " , the absolutely brilliant and stunning arrangement on " curious child " , and the sincere , pure passion of the just so perfect r&b / gospel blend of " savior " . " joint 2 joint " is impressive just for having so much variety in terms of sounds and elements , with each part so effectively enhancing a different part of the story . the first two discs are really solid overall . the third disc however finds prince trying his hand at techno and other forms of conventional dance / club music , and the results are not very impressive . but , i do n't see how they could be , even coming from prince . techno for the most part is insanely repetitive , monotonous , and downright drone-like . there are only three songs on disc three that were really worth it ( slave , my computer , and the title track ) . well , maybe four , his cover of " la la ( means i love you ) " is actually really good too . those songs could have been put on the first two discs and the 3rd disc really could have been omitted . the most impressive feat that he manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great chorus and a great song out of the line " www ' dot ' emale ` dot ' com " on " emale " : - ) . i was unaware of this feat for a while because i used to always skip this song because it started off with that really annoying 90 's g-funk whistle . so overall , this album really does rank amongst prince 's best work , and it should especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more ballads and dive into more r&b

dvd neg 747.txt this might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year-old who aspires to be a mass murderer . there is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property . even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of tarantino 's " kill bill " films , his salute to the genre , or " reservoir dogs , " which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence .

health neg 311.txt unfortunately , my experience was completely different . starting with the unprofessional shipping . shaver and components were shipped in a box stuffed with old newspapers instead of professional packing material . shaver and trimmer are almost exactly lifesize in the screenshot on this page ! ! i felt mislead by the pictures . another person said how impressive the shaver is . i had the exact opposite experience . i picked it up and i was more than underwhelmed . the shaver is about the size of a saltshaker and the battery accounts for the weight , not the motor . not to be mean , but the shaver reminds me of something i might pickup in a 99 cents store . the other day i found a far better shaver from remington for about $8 in my local raley 's store . of course , to find out about this seiko shaver first hand you 'll need to open the shrink wrap which then in turns makes it almost moot to return the item , because donner charges a 35% sanitary disposal fee if you open the item . on top of that the shipping charges are also non-refundable . on the other hand , if i return the $8 grocery store shaver to the store , i 'd get a full refund , if i 'm not happy with the product . ok , so how well does it shave ? not bad , but also not any better than the $8 shaver from my grocery store . the blade component seems extremely flimsy ( essentially 3 tiny blades stuck to a piece of plastic ) and if you do decide to use this shaver , you 'll be ordering replacement blades in no time . all in all , i was not happy with my purchase in the least . $60 spent on something that should be around $10

music pos 331.txt it would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the mahler eighth ever recorded ; i believe it is . but it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something , because after experiencing this colossal achievement , the competition ( including , alphabetically , abbado , bernstein , chailly , haitink , horenstein , kubelik , nagano , olson [colorado mahlerfest] , solti , and tennstedt , among others ) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had . what sets this mahler eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy ; of a transcendent vision being communicated , of a religious fervor . mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work , such that he could bring us to the brink and say , " there . it 's out there . you ca n't see it , but you can divine it " ( and call " it " what you will : " god " or " love " or some all-embracing power outside of ourselves ) . most performances miss the mark , then , in one of two ways : by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand . the problem , of course , is that if we can understand it , it 's no longer a vision , it 's something mundane . in the closing pages of wit 's extraordinary ( and that word , as well as any other , hardly begins to do it justice ) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension . you know it 's there only because you 're willing to take that leap of faith . and that 's what i mean when i say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor . there is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion i 'm referring to here . so let 's look at the basic components of the performance , element by element : the sound : spectacularly natural and all-encompassing . the soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra , and the chorus , orchestra , and organ blend to perfection . the soloists : to a letter the finest group i have ever heard . there 's a distinctly slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given mahler 's bohemian roots , and a refreshing lack of self-importance . no operatic grandstanding here . and for the first time ever i felt as though i was missing something by not following the words ( no libretto is provided , though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere ) because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing . they were n't going through the motions , making pretty sounds . they had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it . to be honest , part ii has often bored me to tears ( with chailly 's performance being particularly offensive in this regard ) but here i was literally on the edge of my seat throughout , impatient to hear what ( and who ) came next . and throughout it all , so importantly , there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end . the choruses : easily the best i 've ever heard . the way they rip into " hostem repellas longius " with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part i is unforgettable , and the fugue itself , which has never reminded me more of the " rabble " section from the first movement of mahler 's third , literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course . that 's nothing . i got chills right at the beginning of the chorus mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not abated ! i have never experienced anything like that before . ever . and i do n't just mean while listening to music . the conductor : what can i say ? he holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before . how ? i have no idea , but when the start of part ii does n't jar , as it usually does , you know you 're in for something special . maybe it 's because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual , or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part ( the first entry of the soloists , for instance , is so raptly caressing ) . the orchestra : while they do n't have the " mahler sound " that the concertgebouw or vienna philharmonic may produce , there 's an earthiness ( but never sloppiness ) that sets them far apart from the bleached , sterile sound of too many american orchestras that make mahler sound not like mahler . to sum up , then , i could not speak for an hour after hearing this recording , and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it , especially those radiant , visionary , and extraordinary closing pages . record of the year ; record of the century ! it crowns not merely my mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening to great music . 
music neg 271.txt there is now no trace of delight left in this band . all songs are either moderately slow and somewhat self-indulgent or frightfully slow and quite self-indulgent . i do love this band and pronounce praises upon them whenever i receive a doe-eyed look saying their name , but this cd and the cd previous ( which did have 1 tune , " apples , " with which one could smile ) does , for the first time , take away any anticipation for their next collection of chopfallen tunes . first , we loose the roses , then the ned 's disband , following that , swervedriver breaks apart and velocity girl is gone forevermore . now my charlatans have become charlatans of the great band they once were . 
health neg 458.txt sure it has many pretty lights and a slick design . one problem though : it is terrible at shaving ! i was using my old braun 6520 , and was quite happy with it . then i saw a good deal for this " new , redesigned , superb , self-cleaning " shaver and decided to upgrade . bad idea ! after shaving with it , it looks like i have a day-old stubble . no matter how much i twist and press it , the " new super system of blades designed by no one other than gillette " does a bad job . this morning i actually pulled my old 6520 out , shaved off as much as i could with this " 360 complete " garbage , and then used 6520 to see how much " clean up " it would do . the difference was both very visible and substantial ! i am really sorry i bought this and feel duped by their marketing.. . do n't make the same mistake as me . buy something else and save your money 
camera pos 106.txt i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it- -it 's size . it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera . i take it with me everywhere , literally , it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket , and i do n't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable . there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched . the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good- -but i was wrong ! the picture quality of this camera is outstanding ( taking its ' size and price into consideration ) . however , i do have a few things to complain about.. . first off , the battery . this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station- -there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there . not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short . the longest i 've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes . this is n't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine . another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function . such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong ! very wrong . the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet . even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up . the flash is very weak . really dissapointing . if you are inside , you ca n't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room . the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function . the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject . to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem . the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot . these are all the flaws i found in the camera , it 's not my first choice in cameras , i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size . if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice .

music pos 81.txt before i review this classic rolling stones album , i just want to point out that juke box hero and whirligig are one in the same person . a troll who likes to trash great music and praise dire straits ( who are a good band but nit the greatest ) and green day . i say cut the shenanigans ! now that is off my chest , back to the review ! the rolling stones ' second album to be released on their own label fittingly called rolling stones records , which was distributed by atlantic at the time ( now virgin / capitol ) , entitled exile on main street was released in may of 1972. the album was the band 's only double studio album but is one of rock 's greatest double studio albums in history and ranks up there with other classic 2-record sets like the wall , quadrophenia , the lamb lies down on broadway and tommy among others . before guitarist keith richards ' heroin addiction took over for some time in the mid-1970s , he was what the late producer jimmy miller called a workhorse . the album was recorded at keith 's home in france and at olympic studios in london and muscle shoals in alabama and in los angeles . keith 's music and frontman mick jagger 's lyric writing was arguably at its peak on exile on main street . songs like the opening rocker rocks off , the 50s sounding rocker rip this joint , the album 's hit tumbling dice , the country-ish sweet virginia , keith 's classic rocker happy ( and it is his most famous track which he sang ) , the slow-ish soul survivor , the fast-paced blues rocker all down the line and the soul sounding shine a light are classics which sound like they could have been recorded yesterday . ventilator blues was another highlight as it was the only song that mick and keith wrote was co-written by guitarist mick taylor whom just tore the place up from 1969-74 ( his solos just rocked from 1969-74 ) . exile on main street was the rolling stones ' second consecutive #1 album and another million seller . the tour in support of the album saw the band getting bigger and bigger . almost 35 years on , this album is still a classic ! this album is hugely recommended

dvd pos 132.txt despite the chintzy , unconvincing facial hair ( jeff daniels ' being the exception ) ; martin sheen 's too-gentlemanly interpretation of gen . lee 's accent ( and his beard ) ; obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war ; generalized ( and largely inaccurate ) interpretations of the underlying history of the war ; and hopelessly , ridiculously , wildly off-the-mark attempts atnew england accents , the film still works . i understand that to get a film produced and distributed , it is often necessary to have recognizable names in the cast . but an unknown who looks more like general lee than martin sheen would have been a better choice . and c . thomas howell 's performance- -well , let 's just say that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting . jeff daniels , however , does an excellent job , in large part because he does n't try to convince you he 's from new england and consequently does not come off like cliff from cheers , using every stereotype associated with nasal ' r' -dropping . instead of focusing on the so-called nasality of the ne accent ( think of sheen in the missiles of octobah ) , daniels allows the viewer to suspend disbelief . but then , here comes ct howell again to slap you across the face and remind you that sheen and kevin costner are n't the only actors who should have appeared as new englanders in an ed wood production . i think the story works because there 's enough commitment to historical military fact to make it believable . the battle scenes probably should have been more visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle , but the movie makers either did n't have the budget for gore ( maybe it was spent on the obviously fake beards ) or decided to err on the side of forbearance . if gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later , it might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction , as in saving private ryan , thin red line , or gladiator . it falls a bit short of that , however . finally , it should be noted that the producers / director seem to be operating on a rather simplistic view of the war 's historical underpinnings , opting to represent the northern point of view as one united behind the idea of freeing the slaves . anyone who knows about the boston busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood . very few who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed in the abolition of slavery . they fought to preserve the union , which is a very different concept . abolition of slavery happened to be the issue that forced the south 's hand , but it was not the sole cause of the war . the movie dumbs this down a bit , making the message more like what you 'd find in a 5th-grade text book . the battle at gettysburg was certainly pivotal , but viewers should remember that it did not end the civil war . the north absolutely needed to win it , but lee continued to cause the north fits for almost 2 years after gettysburg . c . thomas howell will continue to cause me fits every time i think of this movie . still and all , the film is very watchable . and due credit should be given to the re-enactors , arguably the greatest source of credibility for the film

dvd pos 286.txt this film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy . it seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives , not unlike our own . but it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity . it avoids going too far into the subjective . it does n't try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute / stagey displays of animal interaction . instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments . but by the sheer genious of editing and writing , one cannot help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama . the movie wisely lets the animals ' behavior " do the talking " , and does n't try to push the viewers ' judgement one way or the other . it left me rethinking everything i had assumed about animals , emotions , and the nature of our ( and by ' our ' i mean all of god 's creatures ) existence

books neg 263.txt the book is fine , except i had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer . she 's such a boring character . she 's young , but not motivated to work . in fact , she quited one of her jobs when macon covered her rent . the dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men , and get support . the point is that she does n't enjoy the job , thus , a detailed description of her dog training job ( which she does n't seem to enjoy ) was just a boring digression

software pos 608.txt what i like about this software is that it does not come with too many " gadgets . " at my age , i am " technically challenged . " so this software worked out fine for me with my limited computer skills . i also like the fact that this software covers castilian spanish . it is probably the only course available that exclusively covers castilian spanish in such depth since pimsleur and learning like crazy only offer latin american spanish courses . the downside of this software is that you will not learn much spanish grammar with it . if you want to learn the rules and mechanisms required to combine words and form sentences in spanish , you will have to buy a good spanish grammar book . for that i strongly recommend spanish grammar for independent learners by avigail azoulay , arie vicente . it is more expensive than other spanish grammar books but it is well worth the money .

dvd pos 268.txt if you follow my reviews , you know that i felt the version of " jack the ripper " with michael caine as inspector fred abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece . not only was michael caine phenomenal in the role , but that version offered convincing speculation to a mystery we do n't know and never will . while i respect this version with johnny depp , it is more horror oriented . ( michael caine 's version was more historical . ) onto the subject at hand . some of you may know jack 's 5 victims . ( mary anne nichols , annie chapman , elizabeth stride , kathy eadows , and mary jane kelly . ) well , they seem to have a close friendship , and we also get the impression that they share some dangerous secret . ( in the michael caine version , the 5 victims knew each other , but they were just associates . ) well , of course jack the ripper comes into play . one scene is very well done in that while we do n't see his face , we do see some disturbing pictures , and we do see him cutting his steak and pouring blood red wine . in comes depp ( inspector fred abberline ) . it is interesting that while the older michael caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role , johnny depp looks like his character is living on borrowed time and going to die anyday . but maybe depp did n't want to just imitate caine . one thing i had a problem with was that while caine had some trouble with his superiors , depp 's trouble with his superiors is blown out of proportion . ( without giving the story away , his superiors must have known things that they did n't tell depp ! at least caine 's superiors carried some reason on their side ! ) you 'll probably notice that depp finds things out much quicker than caine did . ( probably because caine 's version was 4 hours , while depp 's is only 2. ) while caine was involved with an artist , depp becomes involved with mary jane kelly . gradually , depp discovers things that put together an interesting puzzle . like caine did in his version , depp ironically gets close and almost friendly with the killer . ( of course , depp does not know he is talking to the killer . ) well , another problem here is that in the caine version , we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and was even friendly with caine . we never really understand here why the killer is friendly and even helpful to depp . ( jack the ripper does not have the same mental illness he did in the caine version . ) i will admit that the scenery is well done , the elements of horror are there , and depp did a good job of not just imitating michael caine . and depp 's sergeant godley does offer some entertainment . but if you saw the michael caine version , you will undoubtedly miss the quite probable historical accuracy . if on the other hand , you do n't mind the fact that this version is more geared towards horror than history , you 'll probably find it a respectable horror movie . side note : johnny depp makes inspector fred abberline look like he 's going to die anyday . well , in reality , fred abberline lived on for 40 more years after he stopped jack the ripper . 
software neg 1.txt the easy language 16 is only useful if you 're already familiar with the language you wish to learn . i 've been studying french for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when i 'm getting rusty . the only problem is that it 's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear . the recorded speakers also do n't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said . this is good cause it 's like listening to an actual french speaker and not a robot , bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said . it will also go over basic french grammar but is totally useless if you do n't already know basic french grammar . i also tried to use this to learn japanese . unlike french , i 'm not familiar with the japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare . if all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out . unfortunately the basic japanese grammar and japanese alphabet are all written in japanese . for instance , in the grammar section it has the past , present and future " i am " it 's written in english then beside it it 's written in japanese . you ca n't click them to have it sound out for you . in the japanese alphabet section all it has is the japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out . so it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in japanese . i do want to learn how to read , write and speak japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read , write , and speak japanese ! so my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with japanese ( not the romanized ( romanjj ) version ) already in order to use this product . because of my experiences with this product i would say get it only if you know the languages you 're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more . since i am familiar with french this product was pretty helpful but if i used this as a starter for the language i probably would have quit . i 'm searching amazon for better japanese books . so if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and cd 's

books neg 863.txt as a complete newbie to xml this was a good starter . as i got deeper into xml i found several mistakes / deficiencies in the book , and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about . for instance , the claim on page 86 that ( #cdata ) is a valid dtd element content definition is flat out wrong . his description of schema element declarations ( pp . 114-115 ) teaches that using globals / refs is the only way to define complex elements , and is inappropriate for his example . he makes no mention of globals at all , leaving the reader confused . i have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of xml information 
music neg 185.txt i live in buffalo and i 'm a big prog rock fan ; so when i saw this cd at the library , i knew i had to give it a free listen . but make no mistake - this cd under-delivers on many levels . i always wanted asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player ( steve howe ) , a top-shelf drummer ( carl palmer ) , and a proven bass player / vocalist who was up to the task ( john wetton ) . but there was always a bit too much " pop " , simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me . hey , progressive rock is mostly about " different " , complexity and change , right ? asia was a progressive-pop band ( akin to the later albums of todd rundgren 's utopia ) that made good music , but did n't really pioneer much of anything . same with this cd . there 's little here that 's new or better than the studio versions of the songs . palmer 's long drum solo got boring after a while . steve 's acoustic solos can be found on other yes recordings , and done much better there - here , the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he 's playing tuned rubber bands at times . ( honestly , i remember hearing better fidelity from my old kenner close'n'play ! ) o.k. , it was cool to hear steve express his pleasure at playing in buffalo again ! but the so-called " keyboard solo " by geoff downs was underwhelming to say the least , and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos . i guess if one loves a band too much , they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any cd by that band , and that 's just fine for those people . however , the objective reality of this cd 's value comes creeping in on many other 's existing reviews : namely , the production quality is sub-par ( to the point of being annoying at times ) ; the vocals and harmonies are often off-key ( you really should n't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music ! ) ; this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason ; the packaging and liner notes are scant ; and the performance just does n't add much to the studio versions . this is for asia completists only . asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop cd with their first studio album . i love it . but they never improved upon it , and never stretched out into new territory . perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from " good " to " great " . support your local library . ( and in this case , save some cash ! )

books neg 333.txt thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we 're reading a story . we like to look for clues in what we 've read to help us unravel the plot , and find out who did it and why the crime was done . john grisham cheats us out of that fun . the villian of this book is n't introduced until there less than 75 pages left , which means that when you get that far , you realize that everything you read before then was n't valid . to have some red herrings in a thriller is fine , but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings ? that 's bad . read another thriller instead of this one , one that plays by the rules 
dvd pos 58.txt following the series of firefly , serenity continues the story line for a few more steps . there are so many ways this movie is packed i cannot begin to properly mention them here . the storyline is woven to present images not so much out of sequence but in a " solving the mystery " approach . the english language used presents a plausible development that on first viewing is not difficult to follow or understand - mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing . the animations are first rate and contribute to an unbelievably real quality . the characters are complex , focused , solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations . the challenges the crew of serenity face are many : from their interactions with unsavory underworld bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority " alliance " forces to the overt mortal threat of the " reavers " . the climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue . the music in serenity contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more . i suggest seeing the series firefly before watching the movie serenity to fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters

camera pos 617.txt this is a very good camcorder with the main problem i noted being the dvd format giving only 30 minutes or so of recording in hd mode per disk . it is also a problem that only blue-ray dvd players can play back the dvd in hd mode . even worse that it might destroy the disk if you use it on another player . nevertheless , the price was good and i think blue-ray will be more affordable in the near future . meanwhile , i can playback my video directly or send it to the computer . i am glad i bought it . if a minidv tape version were available at the same price now i think it might be better to stick with the tape version for now though . i was sent a bad power supply with the camcorder but sony sent a new one right away . be careful to buy the correct battery and external charger accessories for the camera as it is a bit confusing as to which will work for it . overall - i am very happy with the camcorder

music pos 488.txt " burnin ' " was the last album by the wailers as a collective group , afterwhich peter tosh and bunny wailer left the group to pursue solo careers and marley reformed his group , calling it " bob marley & the wailers " in 1974. the album shows the original three at their best , balancing lead vocals on several songs between bob marley , bunny wailer , and peter tosh . the album not only serves to further reveal bob 's soon-to-be legendary work , but also to show the talent of bunny wailer with his lead vocals on songs like " hallelujah time " and " pass it on " . the album also shows tosh taking lead with marley on " one foundation " and alongside marley on " get up , stand up " . the album 's biggest gem , however , was " i shot the sheriff , " soon to be made a favorite in the u.s. and the u.k. by rock artist eric clapton on his 1974 " 451 ocean boulevard " album . the deluxe edition also features a concert from the tour in leeds , u.k. just one week before the wailers broke up . ( bunny , however , was already absent , having refused to tour outside of jamaica once and for all earlier that year . his temporary replacement , the wailers ' old vocal coach , joe higgs was also absent , quitting the tour after they completed their shows in the u.s. ) 1973 's " burnin ' " shows the original wailers at their very best before their breakup and is a timeless classic for music fans everywhere , i can guarentee it

camera pos 350.txt this uv filter does it job to protect the lens well . the build is solid ( metal construction ) . the glass is also descent quality . about the performance , it absorbs some uv light . the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable , probably the sky 1-a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for me . now , about the one problem which is the internal reflection . i 've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out that it is not caused directly by the low light / night situation . the internal reflection will appear when there is a strong / bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure ( the surrounding environment ) . to put it in example ( which hopefully is easier to understand ) , when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection . as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides / corner of the picture ( and not in the center of the picture ) , the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear ( if you move the light far enough from the center ) . and if the light is n't too bright / contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection . but of course most of the time , a lamp at nightime is often very bright . but the point that i 'm trying to make is that the internal reflection does n't happen all the time during low light or night time . additionally , the internal reflection is n't only happening at night . it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example . basically same rule as above , on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area , and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side / dissapear ( also depending the angle ) . but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation ( which is not hard to do ) . i 'm actually not a fan of lens filter ( any filter ) as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object , but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens . and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you do n't have any filter for your lens yet . i use this filter on my 50mm f / 1.8d lens and on my 18-55mm lens .

books neg 860.txt this is one of the worst-written programming books i have seen yet . i 'm sorry i bought it . it appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance , and dangerously little about c++ programming . duffy 's review correctly describes the main flaws . i would add that ( 1 ) the book is not structured to build upon oo , gof patterns , or stl design principles ; ( 2 ) the code does not follow even basic c++ coding conventions ; ( 3 ) the images ( screenshots ) are agonizingly unreadable ; ( 4 ) the code listings are in italics using a variable-pitch font [is courier font code listing so difficult to include in a $100 book ? ? ? ] ; ( 5 ) no over-arching component object model is suggested anywhere in the book . some of the efforts at brevity are just plain wrong or even dangerously wrong to teach beginning programmers . for example , pg 19 data types section : - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - int - holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million , for example , " int i = 2000000 ; . " long - same as int . - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - wrong , professor ! this is not only a syntactically incorrect example , but a just plain wrong assertion . if the reader does not know how to determine the ( platform-specific ) size of an " int " or " long " , then the author has only served to confuse the matter further ! furthermore , i consider it a " cheapskate " tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form ( particularly when the book 's code listings are so sloppy ) . that said , i would not use the code , even if it had been supplied for free ... but it *might* have been interesting to have something to play around with.. . have any of the reviewers actually used any code from this book without substantial refactoring ? the only use i could see for this book is for intermediate-advanced fin-techs , who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations ( futures , forwards , etc ) ... but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code

" huh ? ? ? is that supposed to be a ringing endorsement ? comparing these guys to left banke , the zombies or the beatles is pure blasphemy ! for those of you fortunate enough to not have heard the moon before , count your lucky stars . if you feel yourself slipping to the dark side ( the boneheads giving this 4 or 5 stars ) and feel like spending some extra cash , there are other sixties groups more worthy of your money , like the aforementioned bands . i 'm probably going to piss some people off with this review , but that 's exactly how i felt after giving this cd a listen . honestly , i immediately thought of george harrison 's less than stellar second rate efforts while listening to this . i love ya george , but you put out more than one clinker of a northern song . if bad harrison 's your thing......well , then stop reading and buy this cd now ! for the rest of you , there 's a lot of music from somewhat obscure sixties bands coming out on cd right now . garage or psych , a lot of it is great , but the mine is also getting stipped pretty bare . the moon is proof positive . it 's also pretty easy to see why their recording company called it quits after two albums - and the second album is far superior to the first in both sound and content ! in closing , while this album has overwhelming intracasies layered into the music and vocals , the end product is very bland . i read these guys admitted to cutting these songs while under the influence of lsd . it shows ! i rated this " aural adventure " two stars , instead of one , for two reasons . first , i kept rooting for these guys to come up with a decent song to salvage the album ( actually two ) . they never did , but at least they performed all original songs . it 's also worth an added star to see a rerelease from a sixties band that does n't have a cover of " hey joe " on it . if you 're still with me ( and also a lover of good music or even mediocre fare ) , avoid this cd like the plague ! i 'd also like to thank amazon for putting this clinker on my recommendation lists . you done me wrong

camera pos 943.txt i 've had this digital camera for almost a year . it 's the fourth camera i 've owned . i spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that i could carry everywhere . being an amateur photographer ( and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others ) , i did n't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera . it fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse ( for formal nights out ) . the size and weight of this camera is its best feature , and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera , too . this has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery . my pictures have always turned out beautifully , with wonderful color and crispness . i have discovered that the " automatic " lighting feature is not always the most ideal , but you can re-program just about anything on this camera . it 's really quite a good camera , and given its price these days with the newer generations out there , it 's a steal

books neg 854.txt unfortunately , for all the name brand that this book conveys , i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part . there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales , boggles this readers mind . the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session . no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book , and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book , i would be astounded . save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation . by the way , those giving 5 stars either ca n't read english very well or are shills for mckinsey

books pos 748.txt this was an astounding book about an even more astounding woman , rachel shilsky , a.k.a ruth mcbride jordan . written by one of her 12 children , james , this book is both biography ( mother ) and autobiography ( child ) . a polish jew ( white ) who fled her oppressive surroundings in backwater virginia , ruth met and married two different black men and managed to raise 12 children in some extremely difficult circumstances in harlem , new york . not only did she start a baptist church with her husband , she coped with a regular dose of racism , some significant poverty and still managed to send 12 children to school ( all of whom became professionals , and productive citizens ) . the book is written by the son , but the voice of the mother is registered throughout ( in italic print ) . she evades all queries about her background , her family , in fact any of her history , and it is not until much later that the son uncovers her history ( abusive father , crippled mother ) and the reader is even more impressed with the fortitude and will that it must have taken this woman to make her own life in a community that was not of her economic , racial , or religious experience . although the book is ostensibly about this man 's childhood and his remarkable mother , it is also a fascinating glimpse of racism , religion and social exclusion in the black communities in new york in the 1960s . each of ruth 's children experienced a certain unease about their racially ` different ' mother and yet each became aware of who they were and what they were about . this book is just a marvelous read . full of funny and sad tales of a rather unique family life , mcbride 's work is a tribute to his extraordinary mother .

music neg 104.txt greatest hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea . most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact , but this wears thin with repeated listenings . this is especially true of gangsta rap . with what allegedly should represent the best work of b-t-h on one disk , this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself . arranged back to back , the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin . the raps blur together , and after two songs , the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value , sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision . once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention , all that remains are the rhythm tracks , which are serviceable at best . their biggest hit , " tha crossroads " , appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form , further reducing the value of this collection . worse , they include a warmed-over version of " f - tha police " , an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of nwa 's original . spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles . it might have had some value when it first hit the stands , but who wants yesterday 's papers ? c tom rya

music pos 440.txt the best of taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. the albums consisted of two studio albums & quot ; taste&quot ; , & quot ; on the boards , and the two live albums & quot ; live taste&quot ; , and & quot ; live at the isle of wight&quot ; . this band was a power trio led by rory gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career . the band led by gallagher on vocals , guitar ( electric , acoustic , & amp ; slide ) , harmonica , and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock . the music has much in common with cream . however , the richard mccracken and john wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of jack bruce and ginger baker . the undervalued gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of eric clapton . like cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like & quot ; sugar mama&quot ; and & quot ; i feel good&quot ; included here . the music included here is varied . it ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of & quot ; catfish&quot ; to the more acoustic cover of & quot ; leavin ' blues&quot ; . the cuts from & quot ; on the boards&quot ; become more jazzy at times . tracks like & quot ; on the boards&quot ; and & quot ; it 's happenened before , it 'll happen again&quot ; highlight the band 's more improvisational approach . hard hitting tracks like & quot ; eat my words&quot ; spotlight gallagher 's outstanding slide technique . two cuts i miss from this period which are not included here are & quot ; dual carriageway pain&quot ; from & quot ; taste , and & quot ; morning sun&quot ; from & quot ; on the boards&quot ; . the live concert favorite & quot ; sinner boy&quot ; provides a bridge to gallagher 's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album & quot ; rory gallagher&quot ; . this anthology provides a great overview of the early work of irish blues-rock guitar hero rory gallagher and his battered stratocaster . it is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports

books pos 327.txt i dedicate this review to women all around the world of all colour , races , religions , nationality and creed.. . ( all women are equal , in my eyes....nigel. . ) in this remarkable novel , sk makes his debut.an unlikely but good book.it has a good dose of horror / suspense and it is one of the best books i have ever read.. . it is simply about a teenager from maine , named carietta white ( carrie ) .from the beginning of the story we see who her mother ( margaret white ) takes advantage of her , making her feel stupid and left out.similiarly in school , carrie is always the " black sheep " , she has not friends and she is always picked upon.she is very unusual and strange , at least to most people , especially the ones in the book ( story ) . ( but i would say quite frankly that i did n't see here as anybody but a normal healthy teenage girl . ) at the beginning of the story we also see that carrie has her first period while taking a shower at school.she is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet paper and tampons at her.this is her first big humiliation . ( i am a guy , i know not much about a period , so please forgive my use of the term openly ) anyway , back to the plot:carrie soon realizes that she is psychic.she starts to practice using her powers gradually.it seems as though she had the powers since birth , but the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware of it . so , so far we see this:a very unusual girl with psychic powers and a stupid mother . the story initially and mostly circulates around these facts but things get a little messy towards the middle and end . allow me.... . it is later revealed in the story that the psychic gift is sort of genetic.carrie 's mother explains alot of things , but she is still a bad mother . ( but i still ca n't hate carries 's mother , because most mothers are sort of protective over their children ) soon carrie gets her first friend sue.sue feels sorry for carrie and helps her to get a date for the prom . this date is tommy ross.. . meanwhile , one of the bad girls , chris , is unable to attend the prom.so , she sets up a nasty revenge against carrie.believe me when i tell you , chris is a very jealous girl and if she ca n't have something , no one else can , especially carrie . so chris arranges a trap for carrie . ( two buckets of pig blood ) she sets it up for the pig blood to fall on carrie 's and tommy 's head while at the prom.. . the plan eventually succeeds . tommy is badly injured . drenched in pig 's blood , carrie is laughed at , for the last time.she runs out of the building.she then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use it for revenge . she starts to close all the doors.she then turns on all the water sprinklers , wetting everyone . but with a combination of water and electricity ( from the appliances ) ....some were electrocuted . eventually a fire gets started.and things start to burn ! she walks toward her home , burning everything within a certain radius of her powers . when she reaches home her mother tries to kill her , telling her that she is the spawn of satan.she eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers ' heart beat , killing her . eventually ( this is the good part of the book ) , while carrie is walking on the streets ( going i do n't know where ) she seens chris and chris 's boyfriend driving towards her , to bounce her . carrie uses her powers to diverge to car , killing chris and her stupid boyfriend . sue eventually catches up with carrie.carrie does n't kill her because she realizes that it was n't sue 's falt but chris's . ( during the battle with her mother , carrie was stabbed , i forgot to mention it , sorry . ) so , now , talking with sue carrie eventually breathes her last breath and speaks her last words and just , dies . ( this is the sad part , i guarantee you that it would bring tears to your eyes , or maybe not ) but this book is definitely good , i recommend it with all my " psychic " powers . enjoy.............this review was written by nigel... .

dvd pos 741.txt i found the film , " malice " to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery . sure , there are a lot of twist 's in the film , however , that is what i found to be very good about this film . especially the way these twist 's were done . there will be no spoilers in this review . the film begin 's with murders occuring in a small college town . andy safian ( bill pullman ) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings . all circumstantial . moreover , he is having problems with his wife ( nicole kidman ) . something happens to her , and she blames andy for this . [to tell you would give away the film] it seems as if one of andy 's old school friends is now a practicing surgeon ( alec baldwin ) . therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief , and the doctor ( balwin ) in particular who caused this grief to her . but there is more to the story than meets the eye . there are several stories going on at once . first , you have a serial killer , secondly you have a distraught wife ( kidman ) blaming her ex-husband and his doctor friend for what has happened to her . but there is more to her than the viewer suspect's . i will leave this to you to discover . the film is better than the reviews warrant . it is a very suspenseful film full of twists . recommended !

health pos 114.txt doug ritter and his foundation , equipped to survive , has come up with a very economic method to equip yourself and your family with an emergency kit . it is small enough to carry unnoticed in a pocket , yet fully functional . although you can control the amount of certain items if you put together your own kit ( something of a rite of passage among the survivalists / emergency preparedness folk ) , i spent twice as much putting together a comparable kit . the military issue sparklite and tinder-quick , fox-40 whistle , and rescue flash signal mirror alone could cover the cost of the kit and they are all top notch gear . this pack is extremely high quality through and through , from choice of equipment to packing and instructions . i recommend looking at the ets website at the slideshow of how such a kit is put together and what doug ritter himself recommends that you add to the kit ( the pouch can hold a few more small items such as water purification tabs ) . the pocket survival pack is an amazing value . i 've purchased all of the items separately , and just the shipping or driving to pick up 3 or 4 of the items probably covers half the cost ! if you are lucky enough to get everything at one store , you 'd be hard pressed to get the entire kit as cheap as this . i know people who have purchased this kit to take the parts for their own self-built survival kits ! that 's how economical it is . plus , if you buy this psp , a portion of the proceeds goes to the ets non-profit group which gives free survival consulting to deployed troops and is actively involved in improving survival equipment and standards . in fact , doug ritter is the only consumer advocate working with the governing body on personal locator beacons used in marine , aviation , and remote travel . the kit itself comes in a waterproof container . i found it to be a bit tight when closing back up , but there is actually some room for more items . all components are of the highest quality . it 's lightweight and i never notice it in a pocket . with the recommended ets or similar keychain led flashlight and a good pocket folding knife , you have a complete survival kit that rivals ones costing $100+. these are cheap enough to get one for each car and any camping / hiking / marine / aviation gear you might have . i highly recommend this psp . i 'm not affiliated with ets , but i 've come to appreciate their no-nonsense advice and forums . and if this was a bad kit , i 'd still say so . i give it 5 stars , great value for the price and it really could save your life 
dvd pos 76.txt i really enjoyed this film , basically the coen bros . homage to the film noir genre . ( i always thought the name was funny , since it 's french , and yet most of famous directors were german , like fritz lang , otto preminger , etc. : - ) ) . the sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool , unhurried , nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey . thornton is great in the lead as the reticent , phlegmatic barber , and if anything , he is even more convincing with hair than without- -even his hairpiece is 50s-ish . : - ) the whole cast does a fine job in their roles , and both gandolfini and shaloub have a couple of show-stealing scenes . i found the film 's climax a complete surprise , as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber , for whom everything seems to be working out up till then . overall a great film and probably one of the coen bros . best . if you 're a coen bros . fan you wo n't find this one a disappointment .

camera pos 19.txt this , in my very humble opinion , is the most useful , the sharpest , and just about anything else good you can think of say , best wide angle lense ever produced by anybody , anytime , anywhere . lightning fast and that 's what you want when the light is low . my gal pal sara and i have often wandered the caribbean islands in the dawn 's early light , as she is into shooting old homes . she particularly likes the gingerbread homes in marigot , on the french side of st. martin . i swear she must have them all on her hard drive . it 's like an obsession with her and this lens aids her passion , feeds into her manic desire to try and control the light . she just loves it and since i love her , i gotta love it too . seriously though , i 've used the lense quite a bit myself and it 's a keeper if ever there was one . you just go wrong with a canon " l " lense , no siree . jack priest , sailor home from the se 
books pos 390.txt polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant , radical , and all too plausible theory in this book . going beyond a mere analysis of how the market system functions , polanyi endeavors to answer the question as to how the market came about . polanyi 's answer will not be pleasing to libertarians , he argues that a free land and labor market can only come about through government intervention , and must be sustained through further intervention . he also argues that the market ransforms the nature of social relations . usually , economic relations were a result of social relations , under the market , it is the latter . polanyi attempts to show how a market for land and labor came about in britain . his argument that government " enclosures " created it through dislodging the poor and turning their land into sources of economic production is convincing . however , other arguments polanyi advances simply demonstrate a central government repealing the interventions of subaltern governments . polanyi 's argument that there was no " rent-seeking " ( he does n't use that term ) involved in the enactment of state intervion in the economy ( " proving " that this intervention was objectively necessary is suspect . one 19th century investigators conclusions do n't serve to overturn the implications of public choice theory . the greatest problem with this book is that polanyi does n't do too much to back up his arguments . he fortunately has a section called " notes and sources " where he lists his research material , but i 'd wager that most of this is difficult to find 60 years later 
software neg 204.txt my boss asked me to get this , so that he check out the latin portion of it . what a waste ! the only latin on this cd is *latin* american spanish . the interface was underwhelming . i needed to guess at what did what , because the controls are mostly icons . what 's worse , there is no menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program . apparently though , the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back . if you are learning the differences between us and uk english , its there ! i gave this one star , only because i could n't give it no stars

software neg 21.txt acrobat 5 was so buggy that i thought i 'd give adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading . should have waited longer . there have been improvements in v7 : a better look , better commenting , the ability to add text that actually prints , and far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions are way worse than in v5 : some word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7 , seems to be something to do with font license issues . installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs , clashes with standard security software , and endless errors in the automatic update feature . the new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone . despite my already low expectations of adobe , this product is a disappointment . with acrobat 7 , adobe is , as usual , charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version . ( for reference , my system is window xp pro , pentium 4 3ghz , 2.5gb ram ) 
books neg 490.txt i read this book after watching the brilliant movie version of " the hours . " if that 's your motivation , do n't waste your time . my english teachers will cringe when i say it , but this book , well , sucks . it may well be great literature , but the characters are not engaging , and if it was woolf 's motive to out-do james joyce in chronicling a day-in-the-life and in writing a stream of conscious narrative , she does n't pull it off . again , the characters and the internal mental life simply do n't have the power that " ulysses " has . reading woolf is necessary for a good eduction . i recommend , however , that you read " to the lighthouse " . i may still be motivated to read the book version of " the hours " given how great the movie was . but my taste for woolf is all done now .

books neg 502.txt this book sucked because its like an autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was doing...his book is mostly life-stories...and stupid ones at that...some teeter the line of racism , he emphasizes attempting to hex some evil " fat black woman " and he demonizes some other young brothers later on in the book , i see most of the reviewers overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with his emphasis on " race " . and besides that , his 2 or 3 spells and such are old and tired...and there is no " self-initiation " for the type of voodoo he 's talking about.. . i am sorry but this book was a waste of time and money , i came away from this little book knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing . if you looking to learn about voodoo or vodun this book will not help . his title is also misleading because " voodoo " ussually refers to hoodoo and " vodun " ussually refers to the religion but this author isnt talking about either one....he 's just running his mouth on and on and on as if his life-experiences are even worth tellin . this book is a great example to why people of a foriegn back-ground to african based religions should not write books about it as if they could really know but so much.....this was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he obviously knows nothing about

books pos 393.txt a surprisingly tiny book . ( the picture in the upper-left corner is nearly actual size . ) after receiving it , i immediately looked up its dimensions in the description on this page . it says 4.7 x 3.3 x 0.6. i had not noticed that before i ordered it . the book seems much smaller than that . not that that is a problem ; it was just somewhat of a shock to find such a minuscule book when i opened the box . i believe it is intended to be carried with you in your pocket or glove box or the locket around your neck so you 'll have a chance to pick out a few choice topics of conversation before you enter a party or whatever . it certainly is not intended as bathroom reading . for one thing , the pages are much too small for emergency tp use . not that i am complaining , mind you . this is a gem of a book with over 200 interesting bits of trivia listed more or less alphabetically from " the amish " to " zero " . ( this is not to imply that the title of each page has much to do with the text , but who cares - the book is fun . ) each page has its stated " fact " and a follow-up paragraph to expound on the subject . also , there are a number of pages randomly strewn through the book with three " instant personalities " each - little tidbits of info about famous people . ( although , thomas jefferson got his own page , as did alfred hitchcock . ) and unlike another trivia book i purchased recently ( bla bla ) , the information here is actually correct . will and mangesh research their topics , not just publish un-provable " facts " gathered from the internet . use the contents with confidence . 
dvd neg 106.txt i was greatly disappointed in this dvd . here 's why : 1. it 's basically 60 minutes of warming up 2. the level 3 ( advanced ) is not that hard . 3. the annoying " inhale , exhale " chant really makes it difficult to find my ' center . ' i just wanted to tell her shut up 4. i did n't break a sweat once . 5. i used it twice and never plan to use it again . i mean , c'mon , i do n't want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that wo n't get me results . i must say the only thing positive about this dvd is the landscape . in short , rent this from blockbuster or buy it used . do n't waste any more than 5 bucks on this . it 's not worth it .

books neg 351.txt i forced myself to finish this book before i reviewed it , and being through with it now , i feel as though i 've learned very little . i had so many problems with this book , or rather the way of writing , mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author , that this was a difficult read . in his defense , he is , in most things , very thorough . my main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what leonardo was ( or as he sometimes put it & quot ; must have been&quot ; ) thinking or feeling . while i give mr. bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject , in my opinion , that still gives him no right to use what i understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views . since he himself stresses that leonardo 's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings , he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations . in the instances that there is a controversy over some area of leonardo 's life , the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter , but only puts forward his own opinion , and his reasons why he believes what he does , without explaining the opposite side of the matter . in this manner , he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter . sentences beginning with & quot ; i think&quot ; or & quot ; in my view&quot ; are not uncommon . he also makes certain assumptions about the reader , referring often to other artists ' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them . also , he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of leonardo 's , often drawing attention to coloring or texture , without ever showing it , though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout . the author is an undoubtedly intelligent , well-learned man , very erudite where leonardo da vinci is concerned , but entirely overbearing in his writing . overall , unless you are well versed in the renaissance artists and do n't mind being pulled out of a book by the author 's views , then i would highly suggest staying away from this one 
music neg 638.txt bread8 , that 's one of the stupidest comments i 've ever read . you do n't know s*** about metal . you ca n't handle the intensity of real metal because you 're a fat virgin who 'd cry to your mommy if you heard godly metal songs like " immortal rites " and " pleasure to kill .

software neg 201.txt this program is average to below average in it 's abilities . that said , just hope you do n't need any roxio tech support . why ? because roxio 's support bites ! you cannot contact anyone online or by email for help ; whenever their dis-functional " web portal " [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop . i needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is not allowed on the internet . it used to be you could download roxio 's patches from any pc having internet access . then burn patch[s] to a cd , or copy to floppy / jumpdrive . then " sneakernet " the patches to the pc needing them . no more . what happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download / patch a roxio product directly on my pc . [ezcd5 does n't exist on my pc]. instead of simply letting me download it somewhere , like to my hard drive , vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc , [which wo n't work in my case as i 'm not using roxio , nor have it installed on my pc] ; apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download / patch process stop / end and proceed to send the customer back to roxio 's initial patch download page . when you need a patch , all these endless loops and support games are enough to get me looking for a different product / different company . if you want to minimize human contact with customers , fine . but let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going . do n't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a web server . that ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls . then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem . it just does n't work . if a company wo n't provide access to patches , even after i have logged into their website with username and password , [so they know is accessing their patches] and they do n't offer any type of ftp site as a download backup option , then i sure as heck wo n't be buying anymore of their products . i see why roxio bought up cequadrat and other companies . [though i hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that]. when a competitor has a better product , why fight to improve your prodsuct 's quality / features , when you can buy the other company out . thank goodness nero is not under the roxio umbrella .

dvd pos 160.txt eraserhead is filled with strange , uncanny scenes . what is it to be uncanny ? dictionary.com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis ; beyond the ordinary or normal ; mysterious ; arousing superstitious fear or dread ; uncomfortably strange . i would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time . one has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere . the movie does not have a linear , logical storyline . it is a mood piece , for want of a better term . a visual poem , which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen . if you let your mind play among these images , it will begin to invent meaning for itself . you may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it . the cinematography is stunning , not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term , but arresting : you simply cannot turn your head away . will you like it ? well , i think this is one of those movies you either love or hate . think of it as a rorshach - - how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are

health neg 629.txt i used huggies pullups with my older child and started using them with my younger one . when they came out with dora on the easy ups and our grocery store had a huge dora display , my daughter had to use dora not the pullups which have the disney princess design which she is not that into ( i personally think the disney princesses are not a good choice for potty training age 2-3 year olds , i would assume that dora would be picked by more children that age ) . first off the smallest size they have is big for the average 2-3 year old . they did have a size 2t but from what i have seen it has been discountined . i do n't know if it is because they are a little big or the quality they do leak . i have never had a huggies pullup leak on me but these easy have on a regular basis . the design definetly got my daughter not wanting diapers and on the road to potty training but the leakage did n't make it easy for me . i would never use these for overnight use , pullups absorb so much better in an overnight situation . now if pampaers could make a better product or huggies could make a better design then i would be happy 
camera pos 806.txt i 'm like most people with a digital camera . i take a bazillion pictures , develop 10% onto paper , and then banish the other 90% to computer storage archives . i mean , i 'd love to display a lot more of those pictures from my computer , but who has the wall space or time to organize all of those prints ? that 's why i decided to get a digital picture frame . i had been looking for quite some time , but was always turned off by the small-ish lcd sizes or poor resolutions . then i came across this coby 10 " widescreen unit , with the 800x480 pixel display ! there were no reviews on amazon ( at the time ) , but spec-wise it had what i wanted ; a larger display and higher resolution . i took the chance and ordered one and am i glad i did ! the display is huge , and the pictures look crisp . colors are pretty accurate when compared to that of my calibrated lcd computer monitor . the interchangeable frames ( it comes with a black one as well as the white one ) make it easy to match with your décor . the litte remote is easy to use , but easy to lose as well , so make sure you place it somewhere easy to find . the built-in mp3 player is a nice touch . the speakers are n't that great ( it is a picture frame after all ) , but it 's nice to have the frame play music while in slideshow mode . there is a variety of transition effects to choose from . i have n't tried playing videos on it , so i ca n't comment on that feature . that being said , there are a few things that prevent me from giving this 5 stars . 1. the adjustable stand is made of cheap feeling plastic . i 've seen other frames that have much nicer backs . yes , i know it 's the front you are looking at , but the stand should be sturdier , in my opinion . 2. the angle of the stand , while adjustable , is simply held in place by friction . it actually has one setting that it can click into , but then it is angled too much to view at a normal position . 3. there seems to be a software bug that causes the display to act weird in slideshow mode . well , to be more precise , if you are in slideshow mode and you choose either the fade , mask , or cross comb transition effects , then the very top horizontal pixel line starts to show black sections . it looks like dead pixels , but once you exit the slideshow ( or use other effects other than then ones i listed ) everything is fine . i have recreated this problem , but i do n't know if it 's just my frame or all of these . no biggie . i now use no transition effects it is perfect . 4. this is not really a complaint about the product but more about coby 's specs . on their website they state the lcd is 800x480. great ! so i ordered the frame and then resized a whole bunch of pictures to that resolution . however , when i got the frame and started using it , i noticed that all of my pictures had black ( blank ) bars on both the left and right sides of the picture . it turns out that the resolution is actually 860x480 ( which i found out after some trial-and-error ) . it would have been nice to know this ahead of time to save me from having to re-resize my pictures . plus , sizing pictures to 860x480 is a really weird ratio.. . kinda like getting 4x7 prints . i ordered this from total electronics ( one of the amazon vendors ) and it arrived quickly . when i reported the " dead pixel " problem ( which turned out to be a software bug , not a defect , so to speak ) , they responded to my email quickly and offered to take it back no questions asked . now that 's customer service ! overall , i am very pleased with this product . in reality , it rates 4.5 stars . i 'm the type of person that agonizes over something before finally buying it . with this purchase , that was totally unncessary !

music neg 134.txt the lack of someone lurking behind prince 's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the fargnoli management team . this is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster . musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to sade also make the feel of this track disjointed . while prince fans will generally hype this track , the reality is that " 4 the tears in your eyes " this is n't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass . lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121. 
camera neg 573.txt i bought this camera just under 12 months ago and recently the battery cover door would not stay closed . i sent it into nikon along with my proof of purchase and about a week later got a letter saying it would not be covered under warranty . the repair charge with shipping and tax would be $115.22. i am the only person that uses this camera and it was never dropped or abused . battery was only taken in and out maybe 4 or 6 times over the time i had it . for this reason i would never buy another nikon product again . next digital camera will charge without removing battery . camera takes great pictures , but ca n't do business with a firm that is very difficult to get ahold of and does not honor their warranty . bye bye nikon

camera pos 43.txt the case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only . then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses . it makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera . you can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack . my digital rebel xt fits with the canon battery grip and my macro lens attached , however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached . my canon speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag . the lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them . i bought a regular lowepro camera bag , but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached . this bag is designed to have the camera with a lens . if you search google images for the lowepro slingshot 200 you will see what i mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal . 
camera neg 147.txt polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image . i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare , but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some " pop " out of clouds . there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs . for instance , linear vs. circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs. price . if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers are designed to work with those features . linear polarizers has their uses , but they are manufactured differently and may not work . unless you are certain , just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film . i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera . most of the time , when it comes to filters ; you get what you pay for . does that mean you need an expensive polarizer ? of course not , just be sure to get the right filter for your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting . spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money by using step down rings . currently i use the hoya pro1 filters , as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier . the weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly . i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me . when it came down to the images , at times i would see a browning tint on my photos . the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 , but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it is canon , it must be quality . " since then i have replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . pros : can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons : bulky and heavy not neutral color balance 
music pos 30.txt i would say that this is the closest that cheap trick ever got to making a perfect album . there are only two songs on here that i 'm not one hundred percent crazy about...the slow and gloomy depressing title track and ' on the radio ' , which i think kisses up to radio d.j. 's too much . i love the rest of this . this album was my introduction to cheap trick and i would definitely recommend it to anybody as introduction to them . ' surrender ' is an out and out classic and possibly my favorite cheap trick song of all time . like most of the rest of the album , it 's heavy , it 's catchy , has great singing and interesting lyrics , and it says all it has to say in three to five minutes . ' auf weidersehen ' is another favorite tune of mine...it may be one of the heaviest tunes c.t. has ever done . i particularly love bun e . 's energetic drumming on it . zander really rips his vocal chords to shreads on this tune ! another great hard rocker is ' stiff competition' . of the more pop oriented songs , i would say ' taking me back ' is another personal favorite of mine . probably should have been a hit , dang it ! ' how are you ' shows off the band 's terrific sense of humor...i particularly like the reference to one of their earlier songs ! the other tunes from the first half that i did n't mention are also terrific , particularly ' on top of the world ' . my only complaint about this newly remastered version is that it does n't include the lyrics , which were included on the original lp version . that is but a minor complaint . i do n't think cheap trick ever made another album quite as great as this one . 
camera neg 259.txt i bought this camera in oct 2005. i brought it everywhere . loved it . in april 2006 , the lcd screen blew . canon replaced it with a refurbished camera . in march 2007 , the exact same thing happened to the screen and now they will only repair for $97.00 , as they have determined this is the result of impact damage . how they determine this is unclear to me , as it was not dropped or impacted...apparently , you will spend 100.00 / yr maintaining this camera . that , to me , is the hallmark of a faulty product . unfortunate - as i really loved this camera 
music neg 855.txt while filled with talented performers , this cd sucks . rocky is a campy , 1970 's b-movie , that 's what makes it enjoyable . even as a stage show it 's a hokey , rock-and-roll extravaganza . this cd tries to turn rocky into thoroughly modern millie , and it just does n't work . the corny sci-fi sound and less than amazing vocals are just what make rocky..rocky . this cast has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original roxy cast . and lastly , tim curry is frank . his rendition is too ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that is the frank on this album . ripley is a little too legit for janet , and the female eddie weirds me out . buy the roxy cast . it 's so superior it 's almost laughable . 
camera neg 13.txt i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here . i 'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i 've had these problems from the gitgo : -i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly , they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you 'd need force to expand / retract them . very interestingly , if the section right above the one i 'm trying to expand / retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless ! -the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens ( 18-55mm ) a less than 2 lbs combo , which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs . the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly . again , it might have been a defective unit , but i thought i 'd point my observations out anyway . i wanted to buy this from amazon , it was n't in stock , it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to $40+ , so i went elsewhere and got it for $30. 
camera neg 182.txt do n't buy this camera ! ! ! prone to " memory error " & e18 errors after warranty is up . cost min $150 plus shipping to fix . this camera was great until 23 months went by then i started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors . i switched memory cards and it happened again . then the " memory error " displayed after a month or so of losing pictures . now it does n't work at all . i called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem . minimum cost is $150 or i could upgrade to a refurb s500 for $199 w / 6 month warranty . they have to be kidding , $250 get me a new one . for what appears to be common problem i was expecting more from canon . guess i wo n't be buying another canon . google this " canon " memory error " e18 " and see for yourself that canon cameras have problems . 
camera neg 394.txt i bought this camera because i 'm going to jamaica and i needed a camera , the video camera was a bonus . when i first tested it , it was during the night time , however in a well lit room , but i could n't see anything . i figured i could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day . when i stepped outside , which was very bright and sunny , all i could see on the screen was white . i tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen . the only time i actually saw anything on my screen was when i was inside during the day . i brought it back right away , thankfully i had bought it at wal-mart and they were happy to refund my money . i hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera . i would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option

dvd pos 544.txt this one is an old favorite of mine , which i pre-ordered on dvd the instant i learned it was available . i have an old vhs recording of the film , which i have viewed many times . i have also read the book many times , and i consider it to be conroy 's best work . this is the story of four young men at carolina military institute , a fictional military academy located in south carolina , which is of course a pseudonym for the citadel , which is a fine military academy that really does exist . the film is set in the 1960s . the first black cadet ( first year cadets are called " knobs " at the institute ) has just arrived . a secret society within the institute , known as " the ten " has pledged that no black will ever graduate from the institute , regardless of ability . david keith turns in his customary excellent performance as the black cadet 's designated mentor . the plot moves at a fast pace , but nevertheless does not feel rushed . purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many sub-plots contained in the novel . i feel that the movie made the right choices about what to keep and what to delete , and of course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12 hour miniseries . i liked the script , the acting , and the ending . this is a wonderful film . it is the type of film that most viewers will watch periodically over the years , and i am delighted that it will shortly be available on dvd .

software pos 957.txt i have used this software for about 4 weeks since posting my comment in reply to that review . having now had a chance to use the software , i can only say that i am almost 100% satisfied with it . some times , it 's nice to have a spanish dictionary when after a few lessons , you still ca n't quite grasp the concept of the word you 're being taught , but other than that.. . yes , it is repetitious . for those who want to learn another language , this is to be expected . no , it 's not a magic pill . however , in as little as three weeks i found myself largely able to understand what native speakers around me were talking about , even if my understanding of it was imperfect . repetition ( as they say ) is key , but even if it were not , dedication is absolutely required . you can only learn if you stick with the program , and even i have been rather lax about that much . still , i am wholly satisfied with my purchase . it is clear to me that the program is only as good as its user though , and i really ought to be more dedicated to following it 
health neg 407.txt i really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is . not . the motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working . you wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down and it will start up again . but by the time you are getting results in one area of your foot , the thing heats up and stops working again . i went through four intervals of effective operation , heat build-up causing it to quit , waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again . finally i decided it is n't worth the time and aggravation , even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked . one more thing - - when i gave up and decided to return it , i took my duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot . i worry that it might be possible for the batteries to explode from the hot-running motor . i 've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this . update : found something much better after returninng the artemis , i tried the medicool pedisenso professional pedicure appliance . this one costs 5 times the price of the artemis but is soooo much better it is well worth it . the medicool is plug-in electric and has much more power than the battery operated artemis . it has variable speeds , 5 different sapphire filing attachments , and enough power to operate as long as you need . the sapphire files are different shapes and sizes and should last a lifetime , whereas the artemis requires repeated purchases of its disposable filing heads and batteries . so over time the costs of owning the artemis will add up - - if the overly hot motor does not burn out . if you have serious callouses and corns , like i do , the medicool pedisenso will do a very serious , rewarding job . i 'm so glad i found it and i am grateful for the relief it provides

books neg 807.txt the author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological / philosophical foundations of the emerging confession . there is value in that . i look forward to reading part two , the liturgical ideas section . the emerging church is keen on praxis , but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within christendom , which i had hoped we were past . here are some things that i am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book , which it might help to know : 1. rollins does not think it 's possible to really " know " much theology with " certainty . " in fact , to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an " idolatrous " view of god that is more our idea of god than really who god is . this is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans , and because in his view , god was not all that interested in presenting much of himself in any sort of nailed down way . the irony i could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views . he is very certain of his interpretations of " perceptive thinkers like nietzsche , freud , and marx , " eckhart , augustine , etc.. . and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from scripture are correct . i found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really , really , faulty . as i 'm reading along i kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the new testament . so , be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the bible 's basic content . he is certain that no one should be certain , but him . ok , to be fair , he is not certain if christianity is true , and says so on page 44 , but he is certain that he should not be certain of christianity . nor , i guess , should you . with his view of " critique of ideology " how can he be so selective of what he is certain of . this seems like a self-defeating ideology . so strong is his disdain for " knowing " with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all . i was reminded of the case francis schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true , but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway . rollins needs to reread his francis schaeffer , in my opinion . he says the church is not to be about giving answers , but helping raise in people : questioning . indeed , given his views , how could he provide answers ? this book may look deep . i propose , it is merely muddy . 2. he redefines age old terms . orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes , but how loosely one holds it . certainty of revealed truth is dangerous , misinformed , idolatrous . heresy is now a cute little thing . it has come of age . he says people will think his views undermine christianity . we are to just take him at his word that his views wo n't do so , but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would , i think , see the writing on the wall . 3. he seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns . after reading his views i wonder if it is possible for post moderns , those like himself , at least , to even understand the gospel . he has not . how can he be a bridge ? to be a bridge one must have footing on both shores . christianity is based on real events with real content that has been passed down , not without mystery , nor without debate , but in a very real and tangible way . he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else . 4. he is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them . the problem that is huge , and no one seems to notice , is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the christians who are in other camps . he considers fundamentalists , and by logical extension many evangelicals , to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term , heresy . i kept thinking , what kind of " fundamentalists " is he so angry at ? he blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals , making generalizations that are misleading . very unobjective . unkind . very divisive . yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to christendom . i can see his views bringing unity to all religions , but it will never bring unity to christendom . he seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in christendom . times have really changed in the past 20 years . he is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind . 5. he makes god hopelessly difficult . god wanted , it seems , to speak in a plain brown wrapper...the common language of the people , the dust of humanity , the lowly donkey ride , the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel . rollins has wrapped god up in nietzsche and while disdaining " human reason " as the means of knowing god has turned the living christ who said " i am the truth " into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it . god 's message is simple . it 's clear where it needs to be . it hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated . rollins makes it nearly all enigma , hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking god , who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it , yet who has been unwilling or incapable , given man 's weaknesses , or his own lack of communication skills , to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly . if , as tickle says , this is the christianity of the 3rd millenium , then the chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man 's religion , the anything goes religion , and following generations will have to deconstruct today 's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism . peter , i can learn some stuff from you , and i 'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission . as it stands now i cannot agree with you on several points . your views trouble me . nothing against you personally . forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone . i hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more , though , it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor . regardless , if it inspires i 'll come back and add a star . hmmm

camera neg 904.txt the panasonic is very compact , very stylish sexy as my wife called it , but the photos are very disappointing : they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa . the colours are good , and it does take very good videos , but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why : the native resolution of the images . if one investigates such things , will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi , same as sony 's , canon improves this to 180 , and nikon is at 300 dpi . it is not just about megapixels folks , but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution . obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model , do yourself a favour . try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition . set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format , take the photos , pop the sd card into the computer , compare the images in photoshop . enlarge to full pixel size ( 100% ) , and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself . that is what i did , since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly , and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera , and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store , but it was very educational for them too

software neg 301.txt i have been using turbotax since i started working full-time after graduating form college . this year turbotax really drops the ball : 1 ) i did n't have any espp transactions for a few years . tax year 2006 i had some , and that was when i realized that nowadays they force you to use turbotax premier for espp calculations . the last time i had espp in 2000 or so , the deluxe version at that time could assist you to calcuate espp transactions with wizards . now you ca n't with deluxe version . 2 ) for first-time married-filed-joinly couples , they have to do a lot of work trying to merge their filed-single returns from 2005. the deluxe version simply does not handle this at all . even if it helps you transfer the 2005 returns , they do n't merge the data properly . for instance , if both couple have short / long-term capital loss carryovers from 2005 , the deluxe version does not do that for you . same for state / local taxes paid / refunded . worse , if even if you try to correct it , sometimes you can't . there is obvious bugs , and i have to choose override from the menu to directly update the forms . 3 ) nitpick : when you choose to print out the every forms , by default they print out all those only for federal taxes . i have to go to the state tab and choose my state , go back to the print menu , to print state tax forms . i am not sure it that may be because this year is the first year i use the mac version of turbotax ( i use pc versions before ) . but i really do not have a good tax preparation experience this year . next year i may consider to switch 
dvd neg 791.txt with the straight story , lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that i love . this film felt like a " blind date " gone bad . the straight story showed up , david lynch arrived , but the rest of the date felt muddled , confusing , and utterly disastrous . everything in this film seemed wrong . lynch 's choice for lead actor , the bland sissy spacek , the filler of repeat cornfield montages , all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read , i just felt that nobody had control over this picture , yet the randomness ( and the possible tear ending ) gave critics something to smile about . this is not a david lynch film , and for those walking into this with images of mulholland drive , twin peaks , or even eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated . the straight story attempted to show us a slice of americana via the cornfields of iowa , but for this boy based in the flatlands of illinois , it just seemed repetitive and boring . what initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that lynch used to introduce us to alvin and his daughter rose . alvin lying on the ground because he ca n't get up , the cliché use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating , while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame . spacek 's depiction of rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale . she brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes . i expected so much more from spacek with her timeline of cinema , but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors . then , to add more fuel to the fire , there was richard farnsworth . again , he is n't a horrible actor , but it felt like lynch picked him because he fit the role physically , but alas , could n't master it mentally . farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen . i could n't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character . his eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes , and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending . his entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic , while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime , i saw it as babble ( and no , i am not that insensitive - i just felt it could have been handled by a stronger , more professional actor ) . the rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant . i wanted lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all , but alas , it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap . speaking of david lynch , where did he go in this film ? there were some scenes that i witnessed that screamed the director that i love , but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from ken burns ' " looking at america " class . i hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film . instead of keeping us by alvin 's side throughout his journey , lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn . there is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while , but when the same images were used over and over again , i nearly felt lynch was humoring us with the dulls of iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about . i think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film . he needed something to couple with the authenticity of alvin , but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for . i also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way . alvin was a walking storybook , filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well . lynch made alvin very closed minded , which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature . alvin was a strong character , but i needed more with this story . i wanted him to make choices , learn new things , and bring that to his brother 's table when they eventually met . i felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if lynch was saying that this journey through americana was that we could learn from alvin , and not vice-versa . overall , i was n't stunned by this picture . i thought lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just " played it safe " . the overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with alvin . speaking of alvin , why could n't he have been a stronger , better-rounded character ? i felt after watching this film that lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of america , but instead gave us nothing more than soft music , recycled images , and stock characters . the stories were interesting to listen to , but brought nothing fresh to the table . i must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye ( since i have a brother as well ) , but why could n't we focus on this further . lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan , when it was the central focus of this film . the straight story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for lynch , but instead it felt jagged and old . i could suggest one viewing for this film , any further , and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be ! grade : ** out of ****

music pos 465.txt this is , i believe , the best fleetwood mac album ever record by the band . it begins with a nice quick paced tune , " second hand news " and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there . the album itself does not have a bad tune on it . in fact , of all the ' regular ' albums from fleetwood mac ( excluding greatest hits compilations ) , this album has more hits on it than any other . hits like ' dreams , ' ' never going back , ' ' do n't stop , ' ' go your own way , ' ' the chain ' and ' you make loving fun . " all of these get enormous radio play . moreover , ' dreams ' was a number one hit , and the album itself held the number one slot for months on end , and has sold over 18 million copies in the u.s. and over 30 million worldwide , putting into the top 50 best selling albums of all time . in fact , an interesting tid bit from the liner notes of the cd describe how the album had such an impact on america 's youth that during that generation if you were to ask a student to spell ' rumor ' there would inevitably be two ' u's ' in the spelling . now that is a very strong impact on culture . every song on this album is arranged on the album as if it flowed right into the other making for an overall well rounded album . one of my all time favorite songs from fleetwood mac is on this album , " never going back " which contains some great acoustic guitar work from one of rock 's premier guitarists , lindsey buckingham , and , in my opinion , the best christine mcvie song ever written , " songbird . " now , with this release , you can also get , on a second cd , the various rough takes and outtakes of the songs on this album . this makes for great listening , to hear how the songs developed and were recorded . moreover , early demos are included along with two ' jam sessions . " now , more than ever , this is a must have cd for any lover of rock music ( or music in general for that matter ) . if you are a fleetwood mac fan , then chances are you own this album , but if you are just getting introduced to the band , then you must buy this cd . i highly recommend it

dvd neg 982.txt it 's always a shame to see a really talented actor / actress star in a dud of a movie , but that 's exactly what happened to jodie foster with 1979 's " foxes " . directed by adrian lyne , who would later go on to direct the notorious " fatal attraction " , " foxes " is a cheap , lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life . the movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another , making it hard to stay focused . the movie is n't a total waste- -a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention ; and jodie foster , still under 18 when this was filmed , has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she is n't given much to work with . plus , that piano melody of donna summer 's " on the radio " which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel . overall though , " foxes " really is pretty lousy and ca n't be given much of a recommendation

camera neg 30.txt this camera is incredibly frustrating . i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day , the camera takes wonderful pictures . however , photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired . if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light , this is not the camera for you . the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect , the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably . since the camera does not have very good image stabilization ( if any ) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon . of course you can use the flash , but then your subject will be overlit , while the background is pitch dark . and forget about taking long range pictures indoors ( i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding ) because if the flash is on , you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance , it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on . if it is off , your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds . since i take alot of indoor pictures , this camera is worthless to me . if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light , this is the camera for you . if you want to do any natural light photography , forget it .

software neg 387.txt i 've been a digital artist for 5 years and always loved and supported paintshoppro and corel products . i have to say i am very disappointed in the new version , pspxi . no problems with the download , but the program crashes easily , you can not drag and drop as fast as in 9 , basically is slower in everything you do . i am a photographer , and looked forward to the new photo features , which work , but for panoramas and complicated work others than one photo forget it . just hangs up and so slow you could go have dinner in between . i have searched the net and support wise , the upgrades and patches have not helped . corel is not solving the problem and maybe they can't . this is not a pc problem which they so want us to believe . i have plenty of memory and speed on my pc . it may be something involving how the xi stores it 's cache . not sure . but the changes are not workable , sadly . i think there are some corrupt files or driver problems that corel desparately needs to fix and supply us with , or they will find themselves out of the ps market . this is not just me talking , it has happened to alot of loyal fans . because it could be the better than photoshop if they fix it . if you really want the program , download the free trial first and or try the x or 9 version , especially if your pc is an older model .

software neg 730.txt okay.. . so i 'm not as astute in the technical aspects of software as some reviewers , but i can say that my experience with this software is absolutely terrible . first off , it is built to integrate with outlook , but does n't really . it always leaves one e-mail in your outbox ( the one you posted first ) . if you open your outbox before they send , then the one you posted most recently wo n't send either . seriously , the only way i have been dealing with this is that i have left a dead e-mail in the box permanently . if i need to change something that has been posted to the outbox , i have to open it , then get out of the outbox , change it , and repost it , otherwise it wo n't send - - ever . i have set nis so that it does n't scan my outgoing e-mail , as it blocks anything over 2mb , and in my business , i send things that big all the time . in a recent update , however , it has reinstated that and now scans all of my outgoing e-mail whether it is set to or not . i spent hours and hours on the phone with ( supposed ) technicians , who refused to answer any questions unless i disabled my whole network . what that has to do with this program , i do n't know . i tried the " live internet chat " function , but - - and i kid you not - - it took almost two hours for me to get ten responses from the guy . when i complained , he hung up on me . gotta love that . when i tell nis that something it has categorised as spam " is n't spam " , it does n't remember the sender 's e-mail address , like it is supposed to . it just keeps calling it spam and quarantining it . regarding spyware , i have another piece of anti-spyware software called webroot spy sweeper , that routinely finds spyware on my computer that nis did n't catch . this has just been one headache after another . their customer service was unresponsive and totally unhelpful , with not one actual solution to any of these problems . the only piece of software i have ever bought that was anywhere close to as bad as this is winfax 10 , another norton product . i will never , ever buy another piece of norton / symantec software again as long as i live . they should be ashamed of themselves

dvd pos 348.txt cast : denzel washington , john goodman , donald sutherland , embeth davidtz , james gandolfini , elias koteas , gabriel casseus , michael j . pagan . running time : 123 minutes rated r for violence and language . " fallen " starts with convicted serial killer edgar reese ( elias koteas ) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice detective jon hobbes ( denzel washington ) looks on . hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named muscovich ( glen witko ) in a bathtub having been poisoned , the same way reese used to kill his victims . at first hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name robert milano comes up , a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide . hobbes speaks with his daughter gretta ( embeth davidtz ) who at first is reluctant to speak with him . things become even stranger when the man who killed muscovich , charles ( robert joy ) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again . eventually gretta tells hobbes the truth , he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch . the demon azazel seems to be taunting hobbes , ruining his life & career , setting him up for murder & getting to his friends & family . hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him & everyone he cares about . charismatic leading man denzel washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range , while john goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to james gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character . donald sutherland does n't prove to have any range , doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies . embeth davidtz is a talented and totally under-rated actress . she delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future . the directing and camera work in this movie was superb . it was done in such a way where you can see azazel 's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town . although this film does require your full attention , it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours . " fallen " is an intelligently written , supremely efficiently executed , and one of the most unheralded , unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade . one of the better of its kind

software neg 170.txt as is typical with software claiming to be " topo " , it is not . expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for usgs quads this software is not as advertised . since i own the other major competing program ( for which you need to buy each state in order to get quads ( and for which i can not seem to find wyoming ) ) , i was eagerly awaiting this package . in five minutes i realized delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker / mountain biker ( et al ) . you can order quads very simply using the package , but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at delorme decided they would make the map blank ( apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece ) . so , you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it . well , if i knew that , i would already own the quad , and certainly would n't need to buy an electronic version . for 2.50 more i could get it laminated . yes , this is a flame , but it is deserved . delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want ; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go ( and then download , and pay for , the appropriate map ) . all in all , a complete waste of money- -i only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model ( versus selling blank maps , with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you do n't even know will work ) cheers .

books pos 121.txt i am a chemistry major and so i really like this book , however when i initially started o-chem , i did get a little intimidated by perusing through this textbook . so i suggest , to people who were in a similar position as me to also have a look at hornback or mcmurry . the text isnt an " advanced " textbook perse ( after a good grounding in the basics for three days , i found this book quite user friendly ) , its organization is completely different to most other o-chem textbooks and its presentation of ideas is purely mechanistic . both of which are ideally good things for chemistry majors who require the quintessential knowledge of structure and its impact on function and reactivity . an examples is that when introducing orbitals , and orbital interaction ; greeves et al quickly go to homo and lumo based discussions and their impact on bonding and antibonding . wade and mcmurry leave this , one of the most important principles in defining nuclephiles and electrophiles till later . a second example would be the appropriate structural implications of nucleophiles and electrophiles with respect to vacant orbitals , lone pairs and charge . these are the things used to identify em . as such , the book isnt fragmented . each chapter has its specific niche topic and thereofore individuals get a complete understanding of various topics and their implications on the overall organic chemistry . chapters are well referenced so if , say you are only interested in nmr then you can skip chapters and read only those pertaining to that subject and yet still get a good understanding . most textbooks act like a stupid monologue , miss a passage and you 'd completely miss organic chem . the chapter on reaction mechanisms is excellant , it actually is better than most primers developed in explaining this concept ( i.e. jacobs ) . however , the organization and the concentration of information within chapters may be daunting to individuals who havent had enough experience in general chemistry . principles of structure and reactivity are assumed knowledge . organic chemistry in most universities are taken by biology and chemistry majors . for individuals who are only doing one unit of organic chemistry ; i would suggest you look elsewhere . a substitute ( a less difficult but equally comprehensive textbook for people lacking experience in chemistry ) is hornback 's which is renowned for its lucid mechanistic explantion of organic chemistry .

music pos 140.txt actually have n't heard this cd , yet , i can still comment on part of it . i was the lucky guy who did the live recording at the x-ray cafe . sold the masters to the band a couple years ago and just now got around to thinking , " i wonder if they ever did anything with those masters ? " so , i was there at the show and can say that every ounce of energy that the band put out ( which was considerable since this was the last show on their tour , but they knew the x-ray was special and gave it their all ) - it was all captured on these recordings . the machine was a tascam 688 that used standard cassette tapes for 8-channel recordings . most all the mics were either shure sm57 / 58 , but there was also a high quality shure stereo mic overhead that was mainly used for capturing the drum kit but also provided a nice stereo image of the stage . the x-ray was perfect for this type of recording . the tiny pa was only used for the vocals , so , there was no competing with a pa blasting everything . i would place a sm-57 close to every amp . had a nice specialtiy bass mic , too . usually , 8 channels was enough to catch everything , but , there were extra inputs where it was possible to stack multiple mics onto a single track if needed . because of the overhead stereo catching the drums , this was rarely needed . with a full house , such as the night with the gits , any reflecting waves were just soaked up by the body mass of the crowd , creating what turned out to be a very nice intimate recording space . there was split box on stage which fed all the mics to the x-ray " business office " next door , which is where the tascam was setup away from any real danger . all of which made it a fun gig to record in comfort and be able to also go over to the stage side and enjoy the show . every once in a while , magic happened . d . fletcher portland , or 
books pos 820.txt i bought this together with a " best of " cd , both containing a lot of songs i really wanted to play on the piano myself . that combination has allowed me to hear what vince played while also reading through the music to see just what it is he played . without exception , i 've found the written music exactly true to what vince recorded , including pick up notes , tricky min-maj-min progressions , arpeggios , diminished 9th chords , and what-not , and it has made some previously unapproachable passages much easier to understand . i 've also been able to use the book as a sort of learning tool , getting a feel for what a jazz musician really tries to accomplish when he sits down and plays a piece . i would like to have seen some fingering indications included , and without those , i think some beginners will not be able to do much with this work . and personally , i did n't find the performance notations particularly useful ( " laid back " does n't really convey much to me ) , but like i said , i also purchased a cd of vince 's music , so i already have an idea of what sort of sound i want to achieve . other than those two minor points , i ca n't find anything wrong with this edition . the binding is " lay flat " perfect bound , so the pages stay glued together but pull away from the spine , allowing this book to retain a crisp appearance and feel even after the pages are pulled open on a music stand . guaraldi fans and aspiring jazz pianists will gain a lot from this work

dvd neg 20.txt incredible does describe this movie - incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be . at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of " mississippi burning " or the anger and impunity of " ghosts of mississippi " , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre . at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock . as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make . some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence . if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book . i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper . but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own . bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b-grade " miss congeniality " type crud . mcconaughey over acts so much ( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others ) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland . samuel l . jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in . even the extras in this movie are horrible . enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison . this is not " a powerful film . " it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice . maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like " mississippis burning , " that has both a great script and fabulous acting . i do n't know . all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started . among the top of my most over rated movies

music neg 195.txt it is hard to imagine what the american songbook ever did to rod stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this , not once , not twice , but three times . stewart 's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with napoleon 's decision to invade russia during the winter , it is staggeringly ill conceived . the problem , of course , is his voice . the selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer , which are countless . for starters , he has almost no range at all . next , his raspiness has no inherent beauty , and these are songs intended for beautiful voices . by their very nature , the selections are vehicles for skilled singers , their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective . stewart , because he is a rock and blues singer , never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature , expressive voice . he scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes . banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations , ( dolly parton ! ) , do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project . bear in mind that i like rod stewart ; he 's from scotland and he 's the prototypical brit blues belter . if you want to know what he 's actually good at , dig out your copy of jeff beck 's first release , truth . stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded . but that 's the problem . on truth it was the cigarettes , whisky , and swagger in his voice that made him great - it was n't about singing technique - it was about authenticity . here , the focus is on singing , and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted . albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales , nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits . to be avoided at all cost . 
music pos 250.txt ...else if michigan was on vinyl i would have worn it out by now . illinois was my first venture into the sound-world of sufjan stevens , and no doubt it his most impressive outing to date . however the subtle spendour of the earlier michigan has ousted it as my favourite . perhaps less eclectic and entertaining than illinois , but more soulful and beautiful . ultimately it 's the one i 'd take to the proverbial desert island . there 's not a single track in this 74 minute cd that i 'd want to skip or drop from my mp3 playlist , but highlights for me are romulus ( gentle and heartbreaking ) , sleeping bear ( musically gorgeous ) , and vito 's ordination song ( like being gently hugged ) . p.s. so often the ' bonus tracks ' on a cd can seem superfluous and substandard but the 2 extras on my cd ( marching band and pickerel lake ) are both excellent . 
dvd pos 956.txt david cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of stephen king 's novel , and christopher walken was superb in his portrayal of johnny smith ( no middle initial ) . the supporting cast added to the film : martin sheen was a convincing greg stilson ( was this a warm up for his west wing role ? ) , i 'm a big fan of tom skerritt , and i did n't recognize herbert lom from his pink panther role . this movie ( and the book ) are put in the horror genre , but i would consider the story to be true science fiction . smith 's character was in a coma for several years , and the story 's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities . there is nothing supernatural about the villains ; they 're just normal bad people . this movie is not completely faithful to the movie . some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie ( 104 minutes ) instead of a 400+ page novel . some of the changes add moderate suspense , keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first . i do question the need for some of the changes - - i do n't know why johnny smith 's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie ( he could learn things touching people 's clothes or a geographic spot in the book ) , and i did n't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book ( this made for what i considered weaker parts of the movie ) . true science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person , puts them in an abnormal situation , and thus investigates the person 's character . due to the time constraints of the movie , it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience smith had , but they were not absent either . as a result , the story ( both book and movie ) have a feel of a classic tragedy . this movie is not for children , though it could have easily gained a pg rating ( this movie came out the year before pg-13 was introduced ) . the r rating was gained by one usage of the f-word , a couple of seconds of a revealed breast , and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character . ( cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies , like " scanners " , " videodrome " , and the 1986 remake of " the fly " ; this movie had him more subdued , but very effective . ) besides the r-rating , there are aspects of the story ( equally true in the novel as in the movie ) that i find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister . this is because of its dependence on situation ethics . adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of johnny smith because of the situations . in spite of these misgivings , i think this was an excellent movie . i think it was worthy of several awards , such as acting nominations for walken and sheen , for adapted screenplay , and for best picture . 
camera neg 210.txt i bought this camera two years ago , the pictures were always perfect , even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere , but then i found out that it was normal , not good but it usually happens to this cameras . but the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the error 18 ( e18 ) , the lens gets stock and the camera wo n't work at all . i searched in google about it , because the user guide says nothing about this error , and then i read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many canon cameras have the same defect.. . i am really mad and dissapointed on canon , i will never buy a camera of this brand , and i would n't recommend it , unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or less and then throw your money to the trash 
camera neg 847.txt this is an awesome little camera . except that you ca n't use it at night ! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used . apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera , and so dust reflects badly . it 's a known problem [...] also , it 's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology . as a result , the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly ( uhh , have you heard of usb ? ? ! ! ) , and you have to buy a sony memory stick , which probably wo n't work with anything else you have . on the flipside , you can take movies that are n't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology . but other than that , the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick . the lens is not one of those that pops out , so not sure if that affects image quality at all , but as far as i could tell , quality was good . in the end , what good is a camera that ca n't take usable pictures with its flash ? ?

software neg 847.txt i have had trouble and no satisfaction with this product . i am downloading grateful dead concerts from the internet . i want to turn them into audio or data cds . sometimes i get a whole concert as one giant file ; i want to cut that into tracks and save it . sometimes i get a bunch of tracks ; i want to combine the songs that " go into " one another ( my car stereo inserts a two-second delay between tracks ) . one of the things i want to do is to save the files ( which are mostly mp3s ) in the same bit rate and format as the originals , so i loose as little " music " as possible . the mp3 codec seems to be really buggy . most of the combinations of bit rates and codec strategies create really wacky files : some go 5 / 6 normal speed , others are compressed into chopped up shortened versions of the original . when i pick a combination of settings that work , i usually lose a lot of fidelity as compared to the original ( even when i 'm only combinining four mp3 's into one ) . try cutting one mp3 into two , and then recombining the parts into a whole . no matter what i try , there 's a little click in the place where the two files are joined . this should be an easy thing , since a lot of very basic editing is cutting and splicing . the upshot is , buying this was $40 down the drain . i 'm going to have to find better software for my purposes 
camera pos 702.txt i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 , but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned . really nice camera . has a nice dslr type feel . 71% of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 , ( as of today ) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20. buyers may be on the *more megapixel* bandwagon . you can do a lot with 5 megapixels . i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr 
software neg 323.txt i purchased this product with the hope that it will help me protect my computer without too much overhead and interference . the password manager is quite useless . in more than half the times it did not enter passwords . in cases where it entered passwords , it took about 5 seconds to do so . it also asked me if i want to store passwords repeatedly for the same site . it interfered with the operation . it did not let me go to sites like paypal and charles schwab . when i contacted symantec support , their response is to disable the phishing protection when i want to go to these sites . my quicken started having problems . i had to restore old backups and it took me 2 days to finally figure out that it is confidential that is causing the problems . i would have given this s / w 0 stars if it is possible . now , i uninstalled the software from my computer and have no intention of re-installing it . i ca n't believe that a company like symantec releases software that is so buggy and unusable

health neg 495.txt the topmost review described these batteries as " aa in a d package , " which is entirely correct . what certain loser battery brands like energizer do is put a aa battery in a d-sized sleeve , thereby hoodwinking unwary consumers into purchasing an inferior product that holds a much smaller ( approx 2500 mah ) charge than a " normal " d cell ( 9000+ mah . ) fortunately , these bogus d cells are easy to spot if the manufacturer prints the maximum charge on the packaging- -that is , 2000-2500 mah , which is aa cell territory . additionally , the fakes are much lighter than the genuine article- -inside is mostly air . too bad i mistakenly bought a package of these . i 'll have to settle for consoling myself by boycotting energizer for the rest of time .

music pos 43.txt this is one of my favorite releases from common . this chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers . songs like i used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop . not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks . this is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone 's collectio 
health pos 716.txt if you do n't like getting attention , these are not for you . i 'm often surprised by people 's astonished reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off ; i 'm so accustomed to pulling them apart , that i forget how unusual the viewing public finds it . i have been wearing clics for nearly a year . i pretend that i do n't need glasses , but of course i do and have for nearly a decade . popped the standard diopter lenses out , and put in my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite a warning from my optical shop . ( and even if they had broken from the experiment , the price is right : i could try it again . ) previously i was wearing glasses on a chain . besides the various difficulties noted by another reviewer , i also found that the plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses have a bad habit of stretching . then the glasses slip off the chain at inappropriate times and the frames break . i call the color of mine " magenta " - which may or may not be the same as the online " red " - i bought them in a shop ( **gasp** ) . my short hair is not a problem , but i agree that reading in bed does n't work . so i use a different pair for those occasions 
dvd pos 81.txt " above the rim " is an entertaining street drama that focuses around kyle lee watson , an inner-city high school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his own arrogance get the best of him . he wo n't listen to anybody who offers him advice on how to improve his game , as he thinks that he is the best player ever . he 's been hoping that his mad skills are catching a college scout 's attention , but he does catch birdie 's eyes when he plays . birdie is a well known gang leader who offers kyle the good life so long as he plays on his neighborhood team in a " shoot-out " basketball contest that means the world to him . kyle- -being impatient as ever- -agrees to join , not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him . a high school security guard with a past knows the danger that birdie presents , and he is the only who has a chance to get through to kyle before it is too late . not only is this a very good basketball movie , but it is also an intense and character-driven drama centered around the choices that we make in life.. . and how we have to live with them in the long run . the film has some great performances from duane martin , marlon wayans and the late tupac shakur . even though everybody is great in their roles , the showstopper is indeed shakur . he gives a very masterful performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long after the movie is over . my only complaint is the length of the movie . it 's true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and a half is n't short , but i think the story and the characters open more possibilities to add on to the movie . i think more opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich the story . still , it is a really good movie that did n't disappoint me . the dvd does n't have a whole lot to offer . you can either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen , depending on your preference . the movie looks and sounds very good . the only special features that are offered are movie trailers , and those are n't even that great . i would 've loved it if they included the music video , " regulate " by warren g and nate dogg . in fact , given some of the great rap songs that are in this movie , they could 've included a couple of music videos . it 's not a great dvd , but at least it 's not that expensive . i really enjoyed " above the rim . " it may not be flawless , but it definitely does more right than wrong . the characters are what really dominate the movie . even if you 're not a fan of the game , it 's still something to check out if you 're a fan of character drama . exciting , intense , conflict-driven and full of heart , " above the rim " is a very well done film . -michael cran

music neg 60.txt i have not heard of or listened to , this cd series , but from the sound of it , its all bad interpretations of popular music . i just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff.. . play classical music . play stuff without lyrics . play a show on tv where the characters sing . do anything but , buy a cd where people that are n't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place . censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song . there are just some songs that are n't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words . think about this.. . do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song ? listen.. . i 'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible , but cds like this are not the way to go . all they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff , they 're gonna be asking questions . do them and yourself a favor and do n't buy these cds

music neg 739.txt i mainly bought this album because i was going to see them on this tour . in fact the gig i was at was the opening show on the tour . again , the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again . i find most of this album to be very average . actually after listening , this album is not very good at all . the majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics . there are a couple of catchy tracks most notably " safe in new york city " which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic . probably one of the bands weakest efforts 
music neg 622.txt paul brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music . however , content on his latest project , " white sand " is n't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums . the artist collaborations on " white sand " make it tempting to purchase , but you quickly realize brown 's musical wittiness and versatility ( smooth , latin or r&b ) are lacking . overall it is still a cd worth paying for

music neg 490.txt i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan . i 'm a huge pet sounds fan , but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from " the left banke " to " beulah . " this album is not that good , people . it 's not even " okay . " there are way better takes on the " brian wilson " ( read : phil spector ) sound . whether it 's " the ladybug transistor " or " the apples in stereo . " heck , check out a great vancouver band called " ashley park " as well . the production on this is so rooted in the eighties / nineties that it 's almost unlistenable . they may be good road musicians but it does n't show on this album , especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops " a la stone roses . " you would be better off going through the elephant 6 label 's recordings or even merge stuff . to be honest , i did n't even find the compositions that scintillating , regardless of the production . chord and change-wise , they 're interesting....but that does n't make the songs good .

books neg 383.txt as a student of urban development and politics , i can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind . davis offers a hardline marxist view of los angeles that , by employing simply economic analysis , does not allow for the intricacies of the city 's problems . class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of los angeles - - anyone outside of the iso should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel 
books neg 959.txt i purchased this book several months ago . during that time i 've tried several of the recipes - the french lentil soup is very good . the chili and corn biscuit casserole was unappetizing . the chili was so-so and the corn biscuits were too heavy to my taste . the recipe for mushroom , french lentil and chestnut ragu says to " see glossary " for the chestnuts but there 's nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts . it was n't until i read another recipe ( smoky chestnut and sweet potato soup ) that chestnuts were discussed . the mediterranean salad sounds good on paper but was lackluster . far too much red onion ( which my guests mostly picked out ) . although a number of the recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many utensils to prepare . as someone who works full time , a 20-ingredient recipe holds very little allure , no matter how good it sounds . i had trouble finding some of the ingredients . for example , the author specifies several different types of squash which i have n't been able to locate at any of my local grocery stores or farmer 's markets . the book is organized in menus which are not listed in the table of contents . if you 're looking for a specific recipe you 'll have to spend some time with the index trying to locate it which is not convenient . the author definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on my bookshelf more than on my countertop 
books pos 501.txt this book is pitched , at least in part , to linux beginners . but it fails in small , maddening ways when speaking to this audience . after a lot of discussion of disk partitioning and install , page 65 tells you to run the " man " command in a shell session . it offers no clue that the only way to terminate a " man " command is the letter q - a completely unintuitive action . so a new user can flounder forever , or at least until they get frustrated and reboot . but i do n't mean to slam just this book . that same problem exists in most other beginning linux books , even o'reilly 's pocket guide . all these knowledgeable authors seem to think that noephytes will somehow magically gain access to information that the authors have in their heads , but have n't committed to paper . except for that , it 's a very good book .

music pos 121.txt i heard the first beat lp ( & quot ; i just ca n't stop it&quot ; ) in a small town record shop in 1980 and instantly fell in love with this band 's brand of ska / soul / rock . for some strange reason , i never bought & quot ; wha'ppen&quot ; and never got familiar with it . i confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and shying away . of course , i did buy & quot ; special beat service&quot ; and found it to be par excellent . so i ordered & quot ; wha'ppen&quot ; a couple of months ago and it arrived a few weeks back and i 've been wearing it out . damn ! how did i miss this ? this is a great collection of snaky sweet , politically smart songs . & quot ; doors of your heart&quot ; ... i 've loved that song for years.. . and & quot ; too nice to talk to&quot ; has always been a favorite . but every other single song on this cd , including the bonus tracks , is outstanding . these songs are textural wonders . great stinging guitar work and the incredible saxa on his horn make this a stunning recording . i regret not discovering it sooner , but it sure is a nice find after-the-fact . oh yeah.. . one more thing.. . i had the pleasure of meeting dave wakeling in nashville this past summer and he 's a very nice fellow who cares about the people that support him . if he comes to a venue near you , do n't miss the show . you 'll get your money 's worth and more . wear your dancin ' shoes . he is truly one of the great talents of the 80 's and continues to make significant music . he may be the most underrated recording artist of the past two decades . buy this cd . you wo n't regret it . it sounds best in the early evening . i 'm the big oh and i gotta go

camera neg 78.txt i have owned several canon digital cameras and like them very much . i purchased the a520 as a gift for a family member . after several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening . it would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open . the key word being stick or stuck . i took it to a canon service center and they repaired it under warranty . after trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge . i took it back to the service center and they repaired it again . while looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty . it was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time . after emailing canon they said to just email them if i have a problem and they would see what they could do . very poor . i like canon digital cameras but wish i had never purchased the a520. i bought it because of it 's low price , which was a big mistake

camera pos 418.txt i recently purchased this camera . it arrived one day before i was due to fly out to palm springs . i took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures . this may or may not be because i am a novice photographer . even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry , but all others came out better than i ever expected . i think once i play around with it , my night time pictures will improve , but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me . no regrets with this purchase though . also , buy a larger memory stick . the one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and i had to run out and buy another . 
music pos 784.txt since sunset boulevard is one of my favorite films , i bought the london cast album long before the musical came to america . patti lapone is the ultimate broadway star , having created the role of evita . her soaring versions of " as if we never said goodbye " , and " with one look " are unmatched . her power and vocal range soar ! all of norma 's songs had to be drastically reduced in vocal range to accomodate glen close 's lack of , ( or nonexistent ) singing ability . in fact , this dvd was unavailabe to the american market during the american run of the musical and was literally pulled from the shelves . perhaps alw did n't want the american audience to hear the masterwork of this production . kevin anderson , a brilliant actor , does not have the operatic quality of alan cambell in the u.s. cast , but he portrayed joe gillis with far more guts and passion . this is not for the lover 's of oklahoma of showboat , but for lovers of more contemporary musicals , this one is perfect 
music pos 386.txt this remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound , but the only way top hear aoxomoxoa is to find a original w7 ( warner brothers-seven arts ) green label vinyl pressing . the cd features the 1971 remix ( like the 1989 cd ) in which 1 / 3 of the backing has been stripped like constanten 's prepared backrounds on " what 's become of the baby " , the extra drums and barbershop vocal on " doin that rag " . st stephen lost something in the remix as well . anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on cd . no hidden goodies on this disc , but the bonus tracks are great 
books pos 889.txt the story , walk across the sea , by susan fletcher , takes place at a town near the ocean . white people thought themselves superior to others , especially the chinese . chinese were often looked down upon and shunned , mainly because of their religious beliefs . the lighthouse keeper 's daughter , however , was different from other white people . believing her father 's talks about chinese people in the beginning of the story , the girl , eliza jane , meets a chinese boy around her age . after the chinese boy saves her goat , eliza becomes interested in the boy 's behavior . soon , she learns that everyone may not be as they seemed . this story was rather interesting in a way . the time of the story show how the characters act and think . the story also shows how different some characters are , such as eliza 's father and mother . ( " something moved inside me , like a sudden shift in the wind . " ) eliza was also , in a way , different from other white people . she befriended and showed kindness toward the chinese boy . ( " ` you 'll do him no harm ? i have your word on it ? ' " ) i was also amazed by the twist of the story when the story reveals that the father truly worries about the chinese boy . of all of the stories i have read , i have never found one that was perfect . this story is no different . when the chinese people were driven out of the village by angry white people , i could feel the same shock and anger eliza felt . the story , however , has a few more bad parts . one boy , amos , accidentally broke eliza jane 's nose while trying to find the chinese boy . afraid that he might get in trouble , the boy lied to his father about breaking eliza 's nose . to make matters worse , amos blames the fault on the chinese boy ! ( " i had a mind to shout at him , to tell him to put her down.. . " ) on the other hand , i did not like how eliza acted toward the chinese boy when they first met . when the boy yelled a warning , eliza thought he was trying to scare her off so he could steal her goat . therefore , when the boy was holding the goat , eliza thought that he was taking the goat from her , when what really happened was that the boy saved the goat from a wave . even so , that was not the worst part of the story . ( " ` get you from me , ' he said . ` i ca n't be near you now . get out of my sight ! ' " ) as a father , eliza 's father was expected by me to listen and talk to eliza about her chinese friend , and maybe even understand why she was protecting him . as a result , i was shocked and disappointed in her father when he told her that he did not even want to talk to her ! thankfully , there was nothing worse than this part of the story . ( " terrible things can happen in this world-things you ca n't explain away . it 's not safe here , andrew john . i ca n't promise you 'll be safe . but there are miracles , too-like you . and love . and glories well beyond our knowing . " ) the ending , where eliza talks to her baby brother about life and the chinese boy was my favorite part . it ties everything together and concludes the story about friendship

books pos 205.txt dr. mark albion is a consistent and heartfelt- -seemingly lone , sometimes- -voice of responsibility and truth in what 's often a cynical , clutching corporate world . i was energized by his first book , " making a life , making a living ( ml2 ) " and empowered by " true to yourself . " albion builds upon the strengths of ml2 in his most recent title with practical , actionable strategies for transforming your business or career into one of real social value . readers walk away with principles they can start executing tomorrow , and a re-calibrated moral compass by which to measure their progress . and albion lives it : while admittedly starting out with some privilege , he bravely walked away from a tenured position at harvard business school ( simply unheard of ) to follow his heart . to this day , albion continues to shun the easy money , and lives his life by the values he preaches . you can practically count on one hand the number of businesspeople out there who truly walk the talk . whether it be the insatiable drive for " more , " or just the rudimentary economics of opening the doors everyday , any business can very quickly shake you free from your social moorings . if you feel like you 've lost your way , or just need some inspirational words ahead of that next challenge , " true to yourself " is the book for you

dvd neg 329.txt let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie . 1. it is incredibly beautiful animation 2. the music is amazing 3. i happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series the things i do n't like about the movie : 1. the characters are not developed at all 2. you get the feeling your only skimming the surface , like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. it almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process . ok you may have see that i gave this moive a 2 out of 5 , well that is becuase of the story line and plot.the story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation . the movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end . i just kept thinking there has to be more . but there wasn't . the best way i could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just could n't find its parents . this movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff . but if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please do n't buy it rent it first . i 'm not saying its a bad movie by any means , just a bit empty for me.just one more thing the escaflowne series is very very good do n't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series

software neg 910.txt since most of the complaints are from recent switchers i went ahead and bought this because most of their problems do n't apply to me ( running on powerpc , no old data to transfer ) , and because intuit offers a 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee . oh , and i downloaded it from their site , saving like 5 bucks . here 's the thing . the qfx file that quicken uses to get data from financial institutions is restricted . my bank offers the download , so i can get the file just fine . however , part of quicken 's import process is an internet check with the bank to see if they " support " mac users . by support , all that really means is the bank pays quicken to allow mac users to import their qfx files . if not , you get an error message saying to try the import again later . there is a hack floating around the ' net that invloves changing some of the text in the qfx file , and it works . but there are cheaper alternatives out there that support the format ( moneydance is one ) with no fuss . aside from this issue , the interface is really bad . it looks like a check register . if i wanted a glorified spreadsheet in the shape of my checkbook , i would have made one . the program is not even close to intuitive , which means if you dislike / avoid tracking your finances like me this software will scare you away pretty effectively , making your purchase pointless . lastly , the customer support is really very bad . you basically get canned responses that do n't even really address the questions you ask , in semi-broken english . i 'm sure that someone with banks that have mac supported qfx , tons of patience , and is predisposed to dealing with accounting minutiae would find this program useful / powerful . for me , all the advanced features in the world do n't matter if i ca n't even use the most basic ones 
software pos 938.txt i first heard about this product in a bad review of a different software product for converting lps to cds . after a little research , i decided to try this product of the many that are out there . this software is not expensive and for me , it does what i expected it to do . it is easy to set up and use , and i am using it with an audio-technica pl120 turntable . the first lp i converted was stevie wonder 's innervisions , and with this album in particular , the songs run together , i.e. there is no separation between the tracks . this software allowed me to create fairly accurate tracks so i could access individual songs . i also cleaned up some background noise with the " one click " noise reduction , and the music from this old album sounds great . this is my first software for this purpose so unfortunately i cannot compare it to others . what i can tell you is that it is inexpensive , easy to use , and it does what it says it will do

dvd pos 218.txt this dvd gives a very good 60 minute workout . as others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy . the first time i did it , i felt a bit awkward with the steps , but when i did it the second time i was able to follow along with no problems . the dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine . if someone like denise austin were leading this one , i do n't think i would play along . minna is by far my favorite instructor , so i go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout . i would n't want to do this every day , but it is good to have something different in the rotation . i think the toning section is excellent . i am not looking to bulk up . i just want my body to firm up and look better when i wear shorts and a tank top . i like how she combines upper and lower body exercises . it 's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes . i use 3 pound weights at this point and i can see where in the future i might be buying 4 pound weights . minna is a great instructor . she has excellent cueing and is very encouraging . she is never annoying . i also have her optimizer - balanced blend dvd and i love that one .

books pos 918.txt this is a very thorough , very exhaustive look at the life of the sixth president of the united states , and while it may not be as easily readable as , say , david mccullough 's & quot ; truman&quot ; , it is certainly less dry and slow-going than most scholarly works . if you 're looking for a full-life biography of monroe , one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure 's life , this is an excellent choice . if you 're looking for light reading with a historical basis , this is definitely not what you 're looking for 
books neg 391.txt native tongue by carl hiaasen this book is fast paced , has a lot of energy , and a zany weirdness . no doubt , it is a page-turner . and it is better than the other book of hiaasen 's i have read , double whammy . but all that does not a good read make.. . a strength of hiaasen 's books are his characters , well defined and numerous . most are straightforward stereotypes , from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist , the vapid sex-phone girlfriend , a steroid-doped strongman , the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy , a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop , to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars , and loads of redneck florida " crackers " . hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops , and by casting two characters that are quite original , an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman , and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman . and we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins . etc. etc. so what 's wrong . mainly , it 's that the book stays at a level of tv-sitcom-gone-book . it achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject . one might think that the exception is the environment , but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here . so perhaps native tongue is just pure entertainment ? if you like brainless action , gratuitous violence , gross humor , and zany " fun " , native tongue might satisfy . i have one additional problem with hiassen , and it 's similar to the problem i so often have with michael crichton . these books stink of hypocrisy . crichton makes a ( seriously good ) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science . hiassen 's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society , but hiaasen 's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness . while i enjoyed a few sections of native tongue , i had no doubts at the end that i had wasted many hours that should have been better spent

camera neg 278.txt ok , i was hasty in this purchase . at first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case...about $14 , shipping included . then i got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera i ordered . you see , the dimensions listed under " more details " are for the outside of the case , not the inside ( but it does n't say interior nor exterior , just gives dimensions ) . turns out , not only do you have to click " more details , " ( fine print ) you also have to click " more technical details . " ( finer print ) wish i had now . just wasted $9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case . electrogalaxy will not refund shipping charges , and they charge a %20 restocking fee . so , at most , after i pay return shipping , ( the case is only $4 ) i might get back $2. so , yeah i was hasty , but i was also robbed

camera neg 15.txt as a professional photographer , i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year . my equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often , i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it . i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera . these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them . eventually , the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground . ( this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit ! ) the cord is indespensible if you need it , but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months 
books neg 260.txt i agree with a number of previous reviewers . grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between & quot ; wicca&quot ; and & quot ; witchcraft&quot ; . wicca is not an old religion , indeed it is not much of a religion at all . it has always lacked definite theology ( what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you 'll get four answers.. . ) and grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights . in fact , the book is poor on all accounts . from confused terminology to & quot ; chopping&quot ; of source materials . this is a waste of money

software neg 212.txt microsoft office can be handy to have . the files you can open , edit and create with it ( most notably .doc , .xls , and .ppt ) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options . it 's ( relatively ) intuitive . it has a pretty broad array of useful functions . it 's also obscenely expensive , considering the fact that you can get all of these things - - .doc , .xls , and .ppt ; intuitive interface ; and functionality - - for free . i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers , make basic presentations , or put together spreadsheets . i was looking for basic functionality , but i was pleasantly surprised ; openoffice does most of the neat tricks , too . ( actually , it has a neat trick microsoft can never replicate : it 's open source , so it can respond to the needs of individual users . you just say " add this neat trick ! " and someone will likely be able to do it for you . ) it is possible that microsoft office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that openoffice doesn't . but considering the price differential , i would n't splurge on this before checking . 
music pos 529.txt being quite the fan of grace slick , jefferson airplane , and other 60s groups , i bought this album only having heard two songs on it- - " daydream nightmare " and " outlaw blues " . at first i was a little puzzled- -the great society sounded different than any band i 'd ever heard before . after listening to it about two more times , i realized this uniqueness was a good thing ! they sound a little rougher than your average 60s band , and they were- -grace , her first husband , and her brother-in-law assembled this band out of a few of their friends and it only was around for about a year . the great society definitely is n't a band for everyone , but if you love interesting-sounding music , want to hear some of the earlier forms of psychedelic rock , or are just curious about how grace slick sounded before the *smoother* recordings of jefferson airplane , this is the band for you ! a quick review of all the songs : sally go ' round the roses : a great way to open this cd . pay special attention to the instrumental break in the middle- -it 's amazing ! ( any time this group does an instrumental solo , it will be very good . ) did n't think so : in my opinion , one of the weaker songs on this album , but a fine song just the same . grimly forming : an overall fantastic song to listen to with intriguing lyrics and another great instrumental section . ( i love the tambourine- -it adds an interesting air to the song . ) somebody to love : yes , here it is- -the original version of the jefferson airplane hit , written by darby slick , grace 's brother-in-law . this has a much less *psychedelic* sound than the ja version , but they 're both equally as good . father bruce : this is a very catchy song written about lenny bruce as if he were a preacher . fun to sing along with . outlaw blues : this is a cover of a bob dylan song , i think . grace 's voice on this is incredible . often as i may : another fun song that 's almost as catchy as father bruce . arbitration : this song is mostly some great instrumentals but features some singing from david minor ( he did rhythm guitar , i believe . ) white rabbit : yup , another original version of a ja song ! this song 's about 6:20 because there are 4 minutes of great guitar / sax playing at the beginning . almost better than the ja version ! that 's how it is : a cheery song with fun words . you 'll definitely be singing this one aftewards . darkly smiling : this is another " weak link " on the cd . ( there are n't many , thankfully ! ) it does have some interesting lyrics , though . nature boy : grace 's singing / recorder playing make this song memorable . you ca n't cry : this is a fun rock song , with the usual great guitar playing from darby slick . daydream nightmare : this is one of the more *psychedelic* and dark songs on the album , with great bass and guitar playing and more of grace 's recorder . this is definitely not a song to skip over . everybody knows : also a fun rock song , and yes , another catchy one . born to be burned : this song is a little less exceptional , but it does have a good bass line , and some good guitar . father : a fantastic way to end the album ! this song is a nearly-seven minute long instrumental that builds up to an amazingly frantic crescendo . not a song that will keep you bored

camera pos 867.txt i enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera . my minolta dimage x ( about 15% small in size than this camera ) had reached the end of its useful life , having been around for about 5 years . the minolta had a 3 / 4 " screen on the back . ( this one has a 2.5 " screen - great colors ) the best feature i liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens . i do n't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty . therefore , i was excited that this camera had an internal zoom . tonight i was at a bulls game , in the 300 section ( nose bleed ) , and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of kirk hinrich . the 3x optical zoom is incredible , but more so incredible is the digital zoom . i was also able to zoom into the jumbotron , and it looked as crisp as if i was taking the photo directly . action shots are great . low light shots are great ! it is exactly what i was looking for

health pos 298.txt i recently purchased this lumbar support cushion as a gift for my father this past christmas . i am a physical therapist , and have over 5 years of experience dealing primarily with the mechanics and mechanisms of low back pain and disc dysfunction . i have tried out many cushions over the years , and from my experience , this product is as good as any higher-priced product of the same intent . the composite board insert allows for a consistent shape to be maintained , so the cushion does not yield as easily to body weight over years of consistent use , and the burgundy cover is removable and washable . it is also an excellent size for the average-sized person ( my dad is approximately 5'9 " , ~170 lbs . ) . it provides good side-bolster support as well for an added feeling of comfort around the outiside of the lower back . i highly recommend this cushion when placed in comparison of other similar products . most of the other products out there that are in contention with this one are composed of unnecessary additives , like a massager , ribbing on the contours of the cushion , etc. i 've found that simply maintaining good posture ( not only in sitting , but all activity ) allows for so much more freedom from pain and simple ease back into daily life . again , i highly recommend this product to anyone out there searching for an answer to help alleviate low back pain ; however , i must caution that commercial products are not a cure-all to one 's problems . it 's always possible to alleviate the pain and symptoms , but other steps are necessary in terms of fixing the problem . i highly recommend seeking out professional care from a physical therapist , as it is more than likely necessary that one would need ( at least ) proper education and intevention to help one to get better .

health neg 422.txt before you buy , be sure to check where the pen was made . i have a number of older cross pens that say " usa " near the top , and they are great pens . however , i have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made , and they are of inferior quality . the top and bottom halves are loose , and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap . the first one i got , i sent it back to cross for warranty repair under their " lifetime guarantee , " only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a " handling fee " attached . i was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly , one bad pen . so later on when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect . my advice : if you want a good cross pen , go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in usa . they are n't making them the same anymore .

dvd neg 540.txt while visiting some family in utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid-summer weather . we ended up renting " analyze that " and boy , what a mistake that was ! we were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999 's " analyze this . " the potential was there , it 's not as if writers ( of course it 's never a good sign to see numerous writers ) peter tolan , peter steinfeld , and harold ramis did n't have decent material to work with ; robert deniro , billy crystal , lisa kudrow , and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy . however , this being hollywood and all , another sequel was botched . it 's because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation . despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding deniro and some " fish out of water " situations , the movie seemed to go downhill soon after . the jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over-the-top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as " crossroads . " now either they ran out of jokes , they did n't have enough time to invest in an actual story , or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already ( " the sopranos " , " the whole 9 yards " , " mickey blue eyes " , etc. etc. ) , that there was simply nothing left to write about

" little buddha " is so different but so good as well . after i got coil , i bought two of toad 's older albums : fear and dulcinea . both are really good , but something keeps drawing me back to coil . it is achingly beautiful , vibrant , thoughtful , and pleasurable . it is hearing toad at their best . 
music pos 642.txt more like 3.5. so . half of this album is excellent . the rest is filler . but , due to " times like these " , " all my life " , disenchanted lullaby ( the intro irritates me but it gets better ) , " have it all " ( kinda sappy but i love the intro ) , " low " ( have you seen the video ? ) and " overdrive " ( again , kinda sappy but there 's something about it i love ) , the album is pretty enjoyable . it does n't compare to the first three , but it has its moments . the riffs are slightly heavier , most songs are pretty upbeat . " times like these " is an instant classic with awesome lyrics , while " all my life " rocks harder than pretty much all previous songs . kinda sucks how the best songs are / were singles , but if they had released other songs , no-one would buy the album . mind you , my friend loves " burn away " , so listen to the previews and make your own mind up

music neg 990.txt there 's always the argument that if bach had had a modern piano , he would have composed for it . let 's consider another possibility : if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to bach 's doorstep , he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea , since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the high baroque composers . for listeners who understand what bach meant by equal temperament , it 's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what bach was trying to demonstrate in these " pedagogical " compositions . in other words , the point is lost . 
software pos 505.txt why buy the upgrade when you can buy the full version ? basically cause it was cheap . you will see , old version , new version , 10.4.6 , 10 , 4 , 8 and so on . i just bought the old version and installed the latest update . now i am up to date and for a lot less money which meant i could spend the extra cash on more software for my mac . as far as performance , no faster than jaguar or panther . the benchmarks say faster but if you stare at the screen in any version , the 10 nano seconds you save are not noticable . you will encounter drive issues at some point as this version appears to have issues more often . this seems to be due to the new journaling scheme but i cannot back this up . if possible i recommend you erase the drive you are installing to . in the disk utility , select the erase tab , and then the security button , select the zero out data option . note : you cannot erase a drive but only a volume . this will clear out any corrupt data and pinpoint any bad or damaged sectors . the main reason i wanted this was for the widgets . they are a blessing . calculator , thesarus , package tracking , and many more . tiger only comes with about a dozen widgets but in the widget configuration button , you will see the more widgets option . you will be directed to hundreds of others widgets for immediate and free installation . my favorite is the weather and radar widget as i work outdoors a lot . i am able to quickly see the latest radar and plan my week , all by press f12. no need to interupt what i am doing on the mac as the widgets will pop up in my layout and my activities stay active . click any area other than a widget and they hide away . if you want to wait for a version of the osx that allows you to write your own widgets without taking a programming course , wait for leopard 
music neg 864.txt this cd should not have been released because it adds really nothing to this jarrett quartet 's other three releases . it 's like taking a fat paint brush full of cheap house paint and making a greasy mess of what was a very beautiful triptych . " belonging , " " my song , " and " nude ants " are all virtuoso , spiritually empowered performances and should by all means be purchased and enjoyed . but , i 'd go nada on this one if i were you . i was sitting with my 88-year-old mother listening to the last track and complaining about how lame it was and she said it was " hum-drum . " and she 's 88 , likes lawrence welk and it was past her bedtime . ( it 's past " late night willie 's " bedtime too , i hate to tell you . ) heck , i 've heard high school jazz bands cook twice as hot as this " keith and the somnambulists " incarnation . garbarek sounds like he 's going to give himself a hernia trying to get out the altissimos . i ca n't think of one interesting drum riff in the whole 61 minutes plus . ( neither can christensen . ) les scandinavianes sound like they need about 10 hours sleep and then , maybe , they start thinking about picking up musical instruments . jarrett is as wired as ever , but even he ca n't keep up with some of the tempos and the overall mood is disoriented , forced and cumbersome . how any reviewer can say that this release captures the quartet 's tight integration , displayed amazingly well elsewhere , is beyond me . with the exception of " innocence , " none of the compositions are very good , either . " oasis " has an interesting , if dire , melody line , but it ca n't summon the required ambience because of all of the clutter and dog poop around it . unlike the other three releases mentioned above , this one has very little magnetism - the first track is all rambling rose jazz , where none of the musicians are feeding off each other . i do n't enjoy this kind of jazz , so cliched and unintegrated . it contains that jarrettian need to rush things and gang jump the tempo with heavy-handed neurosis peddled as jazz fusion . you feel like some nut in a bmw is suddenly sitting 10 inches off your bumper , too demented to use the passing lane . ( yes , i know keith has mastered his scales and likes to crack knuckles with tempos and , yes , i now have a headache . ) there is an interesting part at the end , however , where garbarek cuts way back on the throttle and swaggers around in the lower and upper registers of his tenor sax in some nice ways . but the transition is contrived at best and bears no organic relation to the first part . only " innocence " benefits from the fact that these guys are probably taking a red eye flight to new york soon . it is a beautiful lullabye , arguably jarrett 's best composition . true , the " nude ants " version is all you need really , but something happens on this version of the song that is very special . jarrett puts in one of his best , if not his best , jazz piano performances . the composition is perfectly suited to his virtuosity and sensitivities and the somnambulists , who are still pulling a code 9 , ca n't screw it up even if they want to . ( there is a halo around keith jarrett 's head i bet you . ) garbarek ( somnambulist #1 ) plays the melody with a lot of heart , but he screws up the tempo in a very brief , weak improvisation . the man is tapped , knows it and decides it 's time to end the song . palle danielsson ( somnambulist #2 ) misses a lot of notes ( doubly bad on double bass ) and goes off into an ill-conceived , top-heavy improvisation right at the beginning of the song . like garbarek , he knows enough to stop and retreat , letting jarrett take over . i ca n't remember a dang thing about somnambulist #3 ( christensen ) . but jarrett 's effort cannot be touched and he plays like a true wizard . a week later at the village vangard ( " nude ants " ) , they 'll all be playing at this level . if anything , i 'd like to see the pm version of " innocence " included in a compilation of the best concert performances by this quartet rather than a whole release of this mediocre concert . for the most part here , we get hum-drum mountains , where many of the great riffs from the releases mentioned above are handled like a shaky old butler serving up tea , with people getting burned and tablecloths getting ruined . in particular , garbarek 's performance on " nude ants " is far superior to this one and maybe the mean streets of greenwich village got his " norwegian up . " maybe they were n't so sure if they were going to make it back to the hotel alive - new york used to be like this you know - and , well , it just might be your last gig . on " personal mountains , " it 's all polite " thank yous " and japanese clapping robotically . not a tinkling glass of booze in the whole schmooze . not even a bonze meditating for more . but , that manfred eicher , such a card , i tell you .

books pos 537.txt i 'm not a huge fan of this genre of music , but as a very part-time musician , this book was recommended by a fellow friend and musician . i liked this book alot and found it education and entertaining , even if the subject matter was not of immense interest . this is definitely not the fault of the author , who did a fine job of making this subject engaging . thus , i found the read illuminating to no small degree . i learned alot about the roots of punk , how it spread and rose , and the end of it . by correctly defining the terms of the book " the indie years " , we only see what happens to the bands in their formative years . once they sign with a major label , their story is ended . this was both a good idea and frustrating one , as we see the birth and growth of bands , but not what happens to them ( in most cases ) once they hit a major label . frequently , signing with a major label creates / expands both the zeniths and nadirs for a band and i would have liked to have known what happened from there . regardless , this book is well-written and a great read for any person who likes the bands included in the book . 
dvd pos 150.txt tim burton offers the most charmingly off-beat yet visually sumptuous movies in hollywood . from his stop-animation work ( " the corpse bride " ) to dark romances ( " edward scissorhands " ) to horror ( " sleepy hollow " ) , burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably - all the right notes are there , but some are played just off-key enough to create the thrill of tension . perhaps no other director was so suited to film roald dahl 's most famous work , " charlie and the chocolate factory , " and remain true to the author 's vision . most people associate the tamer , goofy " willie wonka and the chocolate factory , " starring gene wilder , with dahl 's tale , but forget that dahl had a healthy streak of lemony snicket sensibility to him . so it is perfect that burton makes a darker , more dangerous film for all to enjoy . the visuals in " charlie " are astounding . the chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate ( not the icky brown water of " willie wonka " ) , and the squirrel-nut-sorting room is a classic of mind-blowing set design . and that is not all - oh , no , that is not all ! possibly the most visually stunning element in " charlie " is willie wonka himself , played by burton favorite johnny depp . depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them , and one wonders what inspired depp 's quirky , nervous , mean-spirited , selfish concoction . depp plays wonka as tight as he plays jack sparrow loose , and he never misses a note . but whereas gene wilder 's willie wonka was more genial puppetmaster , depp 's wonka has a sadistic streak in him , perhaps instilled by his dentist father . this is a great , if much-maligned , performance . the most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly-drug-inspired presence of the oompa-loompas , wonka 's army of diminutive henchmen . in the wilder film , the oompa-loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy " oompa-loompa-do-be-de-do " tune . in this version , all the oompa-loompas are played by the same character ( even though there are hundreds of them ) , and their dance numbers are even more fantastic . however , the songs do n't have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs , which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest . indeed , there are several lyrics that i just could n't catch in this film version , and that is a pretty major quibble . far from a feel-good movie , but definitely a good movie , " charlie and the chocolate factory " deserves to be seen and , for fans of artistic visions , studied .

music pos 734.txt those who liked suede may be looking for more of the same from the tears , but despite the obviously recognisable vocals from brett , and the familiar wailing of bernard 's guitar , this marks a watershed in their repertoire . the most obvious difference is that all the songs seem to have been crafted as ' hits ' ( much more radio-friendly , and why not ? ) . it 's also a more mellow sound than suede ( there were fewer opportunities for vigorous bouncing and hand-clapping at the tears concert i attended ) . another important difference is the guitar work , with bernard soaring off into sonic highs not experienced since reeves gabrels and tin machine . among the better songs are apollo 13 , brave new century , refugees and co-star . though brett and bernard are capable of better , this is a shot in the arm for us disenfranchised suede-heads , and i recommend you turn it up loud

books pos 967.txt leah stewart is a talented writer . i read this book after finishing her most recent novel , the myth of you and me ( which i highly recommend ) . this story is dark and chilling . olivia is a young reporter covering crimes in memphis on a hot summer . when the body of girl is found , the case becomes eerily personal for olivia and the lines between professional duty and personal struggles become blurred as she gets deeper into the murdered girl 's story and life . the characters in this novel are deep and well developed , and the sultry atmosphere of a hot summer in memphis is well rendered . i highly recommend this book

books neg 492.txt i 'm perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read " grapes of wrath " or " east of eden . " instead i have focused on " of mice and men " and his lesser known works , such as " to a god unknown " and , my personal favorite , " pastures of heaven . " i 've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular . when i began reading " in dubious battle , " it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck 's work . telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac , it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac 's radical cell . there is a great ( and misleading ) sense of intrigue - mac and jim travel by boxcar , work secretly through letters , go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers . early on , the pace is fast , exciting , and engaging . suddenly , steinbeck simply fails to deliver , leaving the reader wondering when he 's going to pick up the pace again . after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker 's strike , i expected the sense of excitement to continue . it simply never does . summary of " in dubious battle " - workers get mad . workers get tired . workers get mad . workers get tired . workers get mad . workers get tired . the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking . and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first , they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book . most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration , and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense.. . ...and eating . steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story , because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding , eating , and ( worst of all ) talking about food . there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story , but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment , discussing whatever comes to mind . steinbeck 's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters . but i advise any reader of " in dubious battle " to take this course - after the strike is initiated , simply set the book down . you wo n't miss anything . nothing of great import happens , and only a very few memorable characters ever surface , and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces . i suppose now i 'll give " grapes of wrath " a go . perhaps if it is n't one of his " greats , " it is n't worth reading 
music pos 651.txt this is a wonderful view into what is the best and worst about a tedeschi concert . she can be as soulful as the best of the blues singers but it also exposes her weakness : she just ca n't rock enough to provide the balance her act needs . she 's terrific on the ballads but is n't a good enough guitar player to hold up the guitar playing for a band so they have to make do with her fabulous vocals . she 's got solid keyboards and vocals in support , so it 's not apparent until half way through the gig . but keyboards ca n't provide enough of an edge to the very few fast , upbeat songs and the whole concert lags . zzzzz by 2 / 3rds of the way through . look at the audience at the end of the concert when she plays a lethargic version of " i fell in love . " very few people ( besides the b3 player who has kept the only energy up through the show ) are energized . put this dvd on when you 're in bed with a glass a red wine with your loved one and the fireplace is going and it 'll be terrific , at least until you fall asleep 
software pos 56.txt first , if you 're thinking about using these photos for print , you may wish to think again . most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height , or 1-2 inches at 300 dpi . stretch them bigger than that , and they 'll start to blur and / or get jagged . also note , that if you try to export / save an image from the hemera image browser and select the 300 dpi setting , the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it 's actual size , causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate . you need to use the " use image 's full size " checkbox when exporting images . if you specify a 300 dpi size , and do n't use that checkbox , you 'll get a stretched image . for example , the first image in the collection ( the pocket watch ) is only 384 pixels wide . if you specify 300 dpi and do n't check the " use image 's full size " box , the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide . the stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and / or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project . all that said , if you 're going to use the images for the web , they 're great . you get almost all the images you 'd find in their three " photo objects " collections , each of which is much more expensive than this single collection . the difference is the photo objects collections offer about 20-30% higher resolution ( i.e. the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide , but is 492 pixels wide in photo objects ) and you can save the photo objects images with transparent backgrounds ( while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background ) . for the price , this is a good collection . there are lots of shots with minor variations , so it may seem like duplication , but for someone trying to get something just right , that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered

books pos 428.txt while previous guides for the serial drama " lost " have often left something to be desired , the book " finding lost : the unofficial guide " more than makes up for it . nikki stafford 's attention to detail ( and believe me , *all* " lost " fans should have a great attention to detail ) is thus far unparalleled in any other guide book . you name it , this guide book has it . in addition to the usual episode synopsis , stafford provides readers with all the information they can handle , including keeping track of the appearances of the " numbers " , discussing theories , pointing out bloopers and continuity errors , illuminating connections , and just generally proving that she has watched way more " lost " than any of us . in addition to all that , stafford gives the low-down on each of the " lost " cast members , before they became losties . even if you have watched each episode of " lost " 4 or 5 times , and think you have caught every little nuance and clue hidden within it , i guarentee you 'll read this book and discover things you did n't catch , or never thought of . one of my favorite features in this book is the essay that details and explains everything on the " invisible " map that locke briefly gets a glimpse of in season 2 during the episode " lock down " when the blast door comes down on top of his legs , and a black light switches on , illuminating the secret map . bottom line , this book is a must have for serious " lost " fans . it would also be a great aid to anybody who is just now beginning to get into " lost " .

dvd neg 512.txt sure , this was heaped with loads and loads of popular acclaim by the critics , but the question you should be asking yourself is , will it appeal to the average person ? the simple answer here is a loud and resounding no . here are the reasons : 1 ) unless you 're a well-bred blue blood who knows all about edward ii and loves shakespeare , this is extremely hard to follow , not just because of the archaic olde english-speake , but also due to choppy production and editing which impedes the plot coherence . result ? if you 're not lost you will soon will be , and worse yet , you wo n't care ; 2 ) do n't be fooled by the lure of annie lennox-she is an itsy-bit of a bit player in the overall run of this " movie " and is , for all intents and purposes , inappropriately placed in the middle of it much like the effect of having an mtv commercial rammed in the middle of your programme ; 3 ) let 's be clear about what you 're getting for your 10-15 dollars : it 's not a movie at all , but an arty-pretentious stab at cheap play production with less cinematography than your average soap opera or home movie . further , the " period " is thematically juxtiposed with costumes of old and new , making one more likely to ponder whether their budget was short , not what cutty-edgy-trendy-theme-within-a-theme are they trying to promote . who knew such a tantillizing , heart-wrenching piece of history could be rendered so dull ? 
dvd pos 885.txt how did he have the time to write such a picture , to co-direct it , to act in it and after everything else to write its score ? noel coward 's energies , always remarkable , were redoubled during the second world war , and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism , which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing . in which we serve is still worth watching , but it 's nowhere as appealing as either cavalcade or this happy breed , and its focus on the " life and death of a ship " ( the hms torrin ) is strangely monomaniacal , almost constructivist . over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away , symbols of brute strength like something from a soviet film . the ship goes up . the ship goes down . a new ship rises out of the water . and in between coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat , till our interest settles on three- -bernard miles as hardy , with his striking , long , hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it- -he should have played ichabod crane- -john mills as blake , a tiny little pipsqueak who 's feisty in the standard mickey rooney-jimmy cagney manner , and noel coward himself as captain kinross , tranquil with class privilege and , in the background , his glamorous marriage to the ineffable celia johnson ( so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums ) . hitchcok 's lifeboat had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical , but without coward 's complicated flashback structure . coward stalwarts joyce carey and kay walsh show up as the love interests for miles and mills respectively- -carey , in this movie and in brief encounter as well , treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth , nor good-looking in any way , who 's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest . she must have kissed the ground every time noel coward walked on it . who else would have written such roles for her ? the movie is trying indeed when it goes " serious , " and yet that 's half the fun of it , seeing how often coward plays the " race " card- - " we are an island race " indeed . i teared up , of course i did , during the blitz as the v-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on london households , leading to the death of several favorite characters , and again when coward leads his naval boys into dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half-nude british soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of kool-aid . outside of these scenes , however , the movie is marred by its agitprop and by david lean 's tiresomeness , in showing everything at such a glacial pace . ps , the film was shot by ronald neame who later became a director himself and whose " masterpiece , " the poseidon adventure , sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of in which we serve

music neg 760.txt hate to say it , but this is pretty drab stuff . that said , i 'm hardly about to complain ; how could i ? this was obviously written for a film ( that i have no interest in seeing ) , and mogwai just released ' mr. beast ' , a solid ( if unspectacular ) album earlier this year . i kind of see ' zidane ' as a gift , then . looking at the whole thing from that perspective , it 's impossible to be letdown . but then , retaining much emotion out of this composition is downright difficult . mogwai , when channeling the right energies , create sublime , beautiful music - - truly as beautiful as any form of modern music , to my ears . when they 're a bit more ambiguous , though , the results tend to float in limbo and lack direction . ' zindane ' seems to possess certain elements of both these characteristics to an extent , but the result is surprisingly dull - - at best , it 's pretty ; at worst , it 's utterly monotonous . the ideas are here , too ; it 's not that ' zindane ' lacks drive or intent . it is a focused work . yet , it 's obvious , i think , that the music , contrary to most film scores , desires to refrain from emotional manipulation . while that 's admirable , i find that musically , i 'd much rather be manipulated than dazed ; this is literally music to listen to whilst on painkillers . there are a few nice themes and motifs , do n't get me wrong , but this is all underscore - - mogwai , in the best way possible , has a great gift at handling melodrama , and here they never appear to be guided by the dramatic light . i wo n't sway anyone from attempting to get ' zidane ' , but i would n't hand it out to anyone unexposed to mogwai in some hopes of garnishing their admiration . no , for that , i would naturally lead them to one of their many fine studio albums . for , mogwai is a band , after all - - they are not jerry goldsmith or ennio morricone . for those unaware , mogwai performed much of the score for the recently released film ' the fountain ' - - though they did not write any of the actual material , from what i 've gathered - - and as a musical experience , the soundtrack release for that album absolutely blows ' zidane ' out of the water . in my opinion , it even beats out ' mr. beast ' , so impatient fans who need a fresh dose of mogwai ' oughta check that one out for sure

books pos 803.txt peter balakian 's book , " black dog of fate , " tries to be too many things and sadly fails at many of them . in essence , it is an attempt to tell a sort of armenian-american story which i find not overly interesting or compelling . i wish the author had done a bit more in-depth work to learn about his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it or explain it or share it with non-armenians , for he has much more to absorb and understand himself first . i find the armenianness in this book to be tentative , unengaged and unconvincing . pity , since the author seems to have a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as football , the yankees , modern poetry , and exposing turkish attempts to buy ( among others ) princeton professors to act as mouthpieces giving legitimacy to their vile historical revisionism , practiced by the " modern " turkish state and its organs . it seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories and family testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels . the " i " and " we " and " us " occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy the intimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice . but is it realy ? since in order to make this legitimate , the writer must distance himself , at least initially , from all this old world exotica , and like the reader , question their validity or relevance in present day north american society . what are all these old world , old fashioned ghosts and traditions ? , is the first cry of writer and reader alike , only , ofcourse , to be followed by a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in-place reader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein *this* culture and *this* lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towards materialistic , memory-free , self-redefining , " comfort " seeking and buying mores . in the balakian tale , one encounters suburbia instead of substance , worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul , immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities either towards surrealism , the abstract and unemotional , or else towards medicine , respectability and detachment . young balakian observes but never understands " the grandmother " for she is shielded culturally from being able to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instill the armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find . their crime is self-denial and a march to the tune of america 's mixmaster piper . " be unlike your past and your future will be brighter , " seems to be what america promises , at the very least . the intermediate generation listens and adopts this credo and peter is left to find out but never quite understand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain armenian and to preserve our culture before the final denials on new jersey pateos while enjoying , as if to serve sweet irony , full course armenian meals and the mixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every sunday . peter is lost alright , but as the book sadly shows , he remains lost . paraphrasing or quoting ambassador morgenthau does not an armenian genocide expert make . personal family testimonials of the turkish atrocities does not a genocide history make ( for that , read vahakn dadrian 's " the history of the armenian genocide " berghahn books , 1995 ) . episodic accounts can be dismissed by the turks as hear-say and as mere isolated incidents , leading to more harm than good ( for if better evidence existed , the arguement goes , why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare ? ) . for the story to have worked , for the story to have *really* worked , as i would have liked it to , balakian 's life and lifestyle would have had to have changed significantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect it , and his relationship with his wife who , like him , is not leading a strongly armenian existence , would have had to have changed , solidifying his roots , celebrating his new found identity , and nurturing the metamorphosis by sustained community involvment and grass roots movement participation which , alas , never appear on the pages of this book . how else to explain the lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which balakian is a grand personal witness , except that the transition has not occured ? the ship of armenianness sails by balakian . he is finally aware enough to be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it , but not resolved enough to climb aboard . that is how the book fails and that is how his story fails . this is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit of mid stream self awareness thrown in . for a real story of an armenian finding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future , read mark arax 's book , " in my father 's name ( simon & schuster , 1996 ) , " where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection is replaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisite frankness and power by mark arax . one can only hope that balakian 's partial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence will somehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful attachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer ( not withstanding his laudible actions as an april 24th - - armenian genocide commemoration speaker and an exposer of turkish infiltration in the us academic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade as unbiased researchers ) . this criticism i direct to the predecessor of this genre of american armenian writing first and to balakian second . i speak here of " passage to ararat " by michael arlen ( hungry mind republication , 1996 ) where a disinterested soit-disant armenian goes to armenia in the 70 's and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched by this strange people 's woes and dreams . too little , too late , and always detached , is all i can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or cultural reorientation . much more needs to be absorbed before the essence is transmitted to future generations to take and behold . however , i remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnic identity survival stories *will be* written which will show that the tide of assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of this experiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we proudly call our home

dvd neg 994.txt they say all the major characters come back in ` stitch the movie , ' quickly made direct-to-video sequel to the hugely popular ` lilo and stitch . ' for me , the original film 's most appealing part is , and will be , lilo and stitch , one of the most delightful characters disney created in the last decade . do we still need pleakley when we have stitch ? how about cobra ? or some alien whose name you have forgotten ? do we need them ? no , i do n't think so . but ` stitch the movie ' crammed all these characters into this small film of which running time barely exceeds one hour , together with a weak story that repeats exactly what the original was doing . the original 's idea of ` ohana ' or ` family ' is changed to ` cousin ' this time , but for most of the viewers this is literally a twice-told story , no longer attractive enough . what makes us feel short-changed is , however , the lack of music and scenery , the impressive parts of ` lilo and stitch . ' instead of elvis songs , they have thrown in parodies or homage to other films and tvs like monty python and ed wood , completely missing the target audiences who would buy this dvd to experience the joyful sound and rhythm of this great singer . moreover , the charming , water-color hawaiian scenery is reduced to the generic , unimaginative backdrop which is barely ok even by the lower standard of the disney 's cheap sequels . the only saving grace is the presence of the actors who provided the voices to the characters . except that , and the funny but brief scenes about the lovely pair lilo and stitch , ` stitch the movie ' looks like a pilot film for the original . or perhaps it is .

health pos 687.txt there are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments . i weighed both before i made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments . i am glad i did . the light from the mirror is bright , the slide bar for the different light settings works very well . if you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time . i enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use . the only negative i have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but i am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out . 
music neg 335.txt wow , i can not believe that two of the best songs of the film were cut off . 1. - rock and roll part ii ( gary glitter ) and 2.-get it on ( t . rex ) . the rest has been said in the other costumers reviews .

music pos 552.txt undoubtedly , marnie belongs to the top list of bernard herrmann 's best film scores , a wonderful musical image of alfred hitchcock 's underrated movie . written for small ensemble ( strings , woods , harp and horns ) herrmann gives the music a wonderfully flowing mood , tasteful and delighted along with the dark characteristics in every second bar that herrmann so masterful handles in all his works for hitch . joel mcneely 's reading is simply stunning as ever , so is the performance , but i just do n't like the overall acoustics on these varèse rerecordings with the large hall reverb giving the orchestra no room for details . they simply are overheard in this muffled sound . this is far from ideal for recording a film score and i bet herrmann would not have liked this ! but , it 's a great , great score 
camera neg 85.txt yes , it does provide a bit more eye relief , and can make it easier to see the whole frame ( by making it smaller ) , but there is a major problem with this . the eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this , and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you . this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses . 
music neg 645.txt this is what you want ( 1983 ) was a terrible album from john lydon and martin atkins . after an rift between keith levene and john lydon occured during the recording of the demo tracks , atkins and lydon ran keith off and he quit the band . instead of keeping him on the finished tracks , atkins and lydon removed levene and pete jones ( the band 's studio bassist ) from the audio tracks and re-recorded them with members from their holiday inn band ( lydon hired members from a covers band who performed at a new jersey holiday inn ) . the new tracks and horrible . all of the guitar riffs and rhythm section that were originally recorded for the future album were erased . noise and other unwelcomed sounds were added to the tracks . the original tracks were far superior ( even in their basic state ) to what was released . to hear them you 'll have to find the commercial zone lp . the failure of this disc and the bickering between atkins and lydon would cause the band to become a solo project for the former anarchy king . not recommended 
dvd pos 713.txt first of all , let me tell you , this is not a date movie . this is the most brutal graphic rape movie i have ever seen , and also one that lingers in your mind long after it is over . for me , that 's exactly what i want when i see a movie , one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the impression might be . i loved this movie , because it is very very well made , and the acting performances are incredible . yes , the rapes are unforgiving in every respect , and the misery throughout the film is almost difficult to watch at times . this is not a gory movie , except for the last ten minutes , it is a very disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity , however it really needs to . " the untold story " and " ebola syndrome " offset much of the carnage with humor , but " red to kill " has absolutely nothing to smile about . it is totally and brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty ending . the story is pretty simple , a psycho-rapist is on the loose and he 's going after a mentally retarded young dancer . in the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the young lady . enter a female social worker who tries to help the victim , and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he gets off in court because of a stupid technicality . her plan succeeds to a certain extent , but not like she planned it , and the rapist comes after her full force . the actor who plays the rapist is absolutely sensational , and i might add , the musical score is perfect . the music adds so much to the all ready existing tension from all the horrific acts . the actress who plays the retarded girl is also amazing , one of the best performances on film you will ever see . to end this , this is a must-see movie for fans of this genre , and i 'm just getting started myself . not the gore associated with the two previous cat iii movies i watched , but something even more terrible and unrelenting , and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you anytime soon after you see it . " red to kill " is flatout a good movie , even considering the subject matter . i highly recommend it 
dvd pos 362.txt i 'll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 dvds ago , and it continues with this volume . as for the episodes themselves , they were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs , everything comes to a head and resolves . looking back on the four episodes , the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in japan . this was not enough for a point deduction . at the end of the day , anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons . you will not be disappointed . 
music pos 725.txt i bought this cd before going to see mmw ( with john scofield ) for the first time at first avenue in minneapolis dec 7 , 2006. i had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue 's website . so i bought a ticket and wanted to get " out louder " , which i knew they were going to play , to familiarize myself , but the store i was at was out of it . so i bought " end of the world " instead . while some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first , i still liked the overall funkiness of it all . then....i saw them play . you must see them play ! ! i did n't ever want it to end ! i immediately wanted to see them again ! it 's less than a week later and i have 2 more cd 's ( " out louder " and scofield 's " a-go-go " which they " back " him on ) and 4 more on the way from amazon as i 'm writing this . i 'm like an addict now ! i have to have them on in the car and in the house . i get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they 're on and all is right with my world again . i must say i like " out louder " and even " a-go-go " better than " end of the world " , but only slightly . it is trippy with the synth and the other guest players , and i do like it better after a few listens . i just prefer mmw with less guest musicians 
books pos 430.txt timothy hart lost his b-25 over germany in 1942 and is spending the rest of the war as a guest of the third reich in stalag luft 13. in 1944 tuskeegee airman lincoln scott arrives in camp and is promptly accused of cutting the throat of smuggler vincent bedford . the prisoners demand a trial , their jailers agree , and ex-harvard law student hart is appointed to defend scott , who appears inexplicably less than grateful . in fact their german jailers are more helpful to the defense than either scott or the american officers , or so it seems , as scott 's trial for murder progresses against a backdrop of class conflict , racial hatred and world war . atmospheric to the point of claustrophobia , a perfectly paced plot , and one of the few times i 've been completely blindsided by a novel 's climax . ps- -the film adaptation starring bruce willis is truly gagworthy , stay away from it
